 "Call me Ishmael. Some years ago - never mind how long precisely -\n"
 "having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to\n"
 "interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see\n"
 "the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the\n"
 "spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing\n"
 "grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my\n"
 "soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin\n"
 "warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and\n"
 "especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it\n"
 "requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately\n"
 "stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off\n"
 "- then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is\n"
 "my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato\n"
 "throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is\n"
 "nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in\n"
 "their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same\n"
 "feelings towards the ocean with me.  There now is your insular city of\n"
 "the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs\n"
 "- commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets\n"
 "take you waterward. Its extreme down-town is the battery, where that\n"
 "noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few\n"
 "hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of\n"
 "water-gazers there.  Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath\n"
 "afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by\n"
 "Whitehall northward. What do you see? - Posted like silent sentinels\n"
 "all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men\n"
 "fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated\n"
 "upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if\n"
 "striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all\n"
 "landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster - tied to counters,\n"
 "nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green\n"
 "fields gone? What do they here?  But look! here come more crowds,\n"
 "pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a\n"
 "dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of\n"
 "the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not\n"
 "suffice.  No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly\n"
 "can without falling in. And there they stand - miles of them -\n"
 "leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets and\n"
 "avenues, - north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell\n"
 "me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all\n"
 "those ships attract them thither?  Once more. Say, you are in the\n"
 "country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please,\n"
 "and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by\n"
 "a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent-\n"
 "minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries - stand that man on\n"
 "his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to\n"
 "water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be\n"
 "athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your\n"
 "caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as\n"
 "every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.  But here\n"
 "is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,\n"
 "quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley\n"
 "of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his\n"
 "trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were\n"
 "within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up\n"
 "from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands\n"
 "winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in\n"
 "their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and\n"
 "though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this\n"
 "shepherd's head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd's eye were\n"
 "fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among\n"
 "Tiger- lilies - what is the one charm wanting? - Water - there is not\n"
 "a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you\n"
 "travel your thousand miles to see it?  Why did the poor poet of\n"
 "Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate\n"
 "whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money\n"
 "in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust\n"
 "healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other\n"
 "crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you\n"
 "yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and\n"
 "your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold\n"
 "the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own\n"
 "brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still\n"
 "deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could\n"
 "not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged\n"
 "into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all\n"
 "rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life;\n"
 "and this is the key to it all.  Now, when I say that I am in the habit\n"
 "of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and\n"
 "begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to have it\n"
 "inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a\n"
 "passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless\n"
 "you have something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick - grow\n"
 "quarrelsome - don't sleep of nights - do not enjoy themselves much, as\n"
 "a general thing; - no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though I am\n"
 "something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain,\n"
 "or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to\n"
 "those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honorable\n"
 "respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind\n"
 "whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself,\n"
 "without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what\n"
 "not. And as for going as cook, - though I confess there is\n"
 "considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on\n"
 "ship-board - yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls; - though\n"
 "once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and\n"
 "peppered, there is no one who will\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled\n"
 "fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old\n"
 "Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the\n"
 "mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.\n"
 "No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,\n"
 "plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal\n"
 "mast-head. True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump\n"
 "from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first,\n"
 "this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one's sense of\n"
 "honor, particularly if you come of an old established family in the\n"
 "land, the van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more\n"
 "than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you\n"
 "have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest\n"
 "boys stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you,\n"
 "from the schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of\n"
 "Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this\n"
 "wears off in time.  What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain\n"
 "orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks? What does that\n"
 "indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New\n"
 "Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less\n"
 "of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that\n"
 "particular instance? Who aint a slave? Tell me that. Well, then,\n"
 "however the old sea-captains may order me about - however they may\n"
 "thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it\n"
 "is all right; that everybody else is one way or other served in much\n"
 "the same way - either in a physical or metaphysical point of view,\n"
 "that is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands\n"
 "should rub each other's shoulder-blades, and be content.  Again, I\n"
 "always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying me\n"
 "for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that\n"
 "I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And\n"
 "there is all the difference in the world between paying and being\n"
 "paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction\n"
 "that the two orchard\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " thieves entailed upon us. But being paid, - what will compare\n"
 "with it? The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really\n"
 "marvellous, considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the\n"
 "root of all earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied man\n"
 "enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!\n"
 "Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome\n"
 "exercise and pure air of the forecastle deck. For as in this world,\n"
 "head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if\n"
 "you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the\n"
 "Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from\n"
 "the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not\n"
 "so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many\n"
 "other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But\n"
 "wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a\n"
 "merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling\n"
 "voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the\n"
 "constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me\n"
 "in some unaccountable way - he can better answer than any one\n"
 "else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of\n"
 "the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time\n"
 "ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more\n"
 "extensive performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have\n"
 "run something like this: Grand Contested Election for the Presidency\n"
 "of the United States Whaling Voyage by one Ishmael BLOODY BATTLE IN\n"
 "AFFGHANISTAN Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage\n"
 "managers, the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling\n"
 "voyage, when others were set down for magnificent parts in high\n"
 "tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly\n"
 "parts in farces - though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now\n"
 "that I recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into\n"
 "the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under\n"
 "various disguises, induced me to set about\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the\n"
 "delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill\n"
 "and discriminating judgment.  Chief among these motives was the\n"
 "overwhelming idea of the great whale himself.  Such a portentous and\n"
 "mysterious monster roused all my curiosity. Then the wild and distant\n"
 "seas where he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless\n"
 "perils of the whale; these, with all the attending marvels of a\n"
 "thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my\n"
 "wish. With other men, perhaps, such things would not have been\n"
 "inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch\n"
 "for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on\n"
 "barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a\n"
 "horror, and could still be social with it - would they let me - since\n"
 "it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the\n"
 "place one lodges in.  By reason of these things, then, the whaling\n"
 "voyage was welcome; the great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung\n"
 "open, and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and\n"
 "two there floated into my inmost soul, endless processions of the\n"
 "whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand hooded phantom, like a\n"
 "snow hill in the air.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it\n"
 "under my arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the\n"
 "good city of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was on a\n"
 "Saturday night in December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that\n"
 "the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of\n"
 "reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday.  As most\n"
 "young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " stop at this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their\n"
 "voyage, it may as well be related that I, for one, had no idea of so\n"
 "doing. For my mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket\n"
 "craft, because there was a fine, boisterous something about everything\n"
 "connected with that famous old island, which amazingly pleased\n"
 "me. Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolizing\n"
 "the business of whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket\n"
 "is now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her great original - the\n"
 "Tyre of this Carthage; - the place where the first dead American whale\n"
 "was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal\n"
 "whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to give chase to the\n"
 "Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first\n"
 "adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported\n"
 "cobble-stones - so goes the story - to throw at the whales, in order\n"
 "to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the\n"
 "bowsprit?  Now having a night, a day, and still another night\n"
 "following before me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined\n"
 "port, it became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep\n"
 "meanwhile. It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal\n"
 "night, bitingly cold and cheerless.  I knew no one in the place. With\n"
 "anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few\n"
 "pieces of silver, - So, wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as\n"
 "I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag, and\n"
 "comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the\n"
 "south - wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the\n"
 "night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the price, and don't be too\n"
 "particular.  With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the\n"
 "sign of \"The Crossed Harpoons\" - but it looked too expensive and jolly\n"
 "there. Further on, from the bright red windows of the \"Sword-Fish\n"
 "Inn\", there came such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the\n"
 "packed snow and ice from before the house, for everywhere else the\n"
 "congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement, -\n"
 "rather weary for me, when I struck my foot against the flinty\n"
 "projections, because from hard, remorseless\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable\n"
 "plight. Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment\n"
 "to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of the\n"
 "tinkling glasses within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don't you\n"
 "hear? get away from before the door; your patched boots are stopping\n"
 "the way. So on I went. I now by instinct followed the streets that\n"
 "took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the\n"
 "cheeriest inns.  Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses,\n"
 "on either hand, and here and there a candle, like a candle moving\n"
 "about in a tomb. At this hour of the night, of the last day of the\n"
 "week, that quarter of the town proved all but deserted. But presently\n"
 "I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide building, the door\n"
 "of which stood invitingly open. It had a careless look, as if it were\n"
 "meant for the uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did\n"
 "was to stumble over an ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the\n"
 "flying particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed\n"
 "city, Gomorrah?  But \"The Crossed Harpoons,\" and \"The Sword-Fish?\" -\n"
 "this, then, must needs be the sign of \"The Trap\". However, I picked\n"
 "myself up and hearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a\n"
 "second, interior door.  It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting\n"
 "in Tophet. A hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer;\n"
 "and beyond, a black Angel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It\n"
 "was a negro church; and the preacher's text was about the blackness of\n"
 "darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth- gnashing there. Ha,\n"
 "Ishmael, muttered I, backing out, Wretched entertainment at the sign\n"
 "of \"The Trap!\"  Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not\n"
 "far from the docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and\n"
 "looking up, saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting\n"
 "upon it, faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray, and\n"
 "these words underneath - \"The Spouter- Inn: - Peter Coffin.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "Coffin? - Spouter? - Rather ominous in that particular connexion,\n"
 "thought I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I\n"
 "suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked\n"
 "so dim, and the place, for the time, looked\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " quiet enough, and the dilapidated little wooden house itself\n"
 "looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some\n"
 "burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort\n"
 "of creak to it, I thought that here was the very spot for cheap\n"
 "lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.  It was a queer sort of place -\n"
 "a gable-ended old house, one side palsied as it were, and leaning over\n"
 "sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner, where that tempestuous wind\n"
 "Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor Paul's\n"
 "tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to\n"
 "any one in-doors, with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for\n"
 "bed. \"In judging of that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon,\" says an\n"
 "old writer - of whose works I possess the only copy extant - \"it\n"
 "maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou lookest out at it from a\n"
 "glass window where the frost is all on the outside, or whether thou\n"
 "observest it from that sashless window, where the frost is on both\n"
 "sides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier.\" True enough,\n"
 "thought I, as this passage occurred to my mind - old black-letter,\n"
 "thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of\n"
 "mine is the house.  What a pity they didn't stop up the chinks and the\n"
 "crannies though, and thrust in a little lint here and there. But it's\n"
 "too late to make any improvements now.  The universe is finished; the\n"
 "copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years\n"
 "ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone\n"
 "for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he\n"
 "might plug up both ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth,\n"
 "and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous\n"
 "Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red silken wrapper -\n"
 "(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a fine frosty night;\n"
 "how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of their\n"
 "oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the\n"
 "privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.  But what thinks\n"
 "Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand\n"
 "northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than here?\n"
 "Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the\n"
 "equator; yea, ye\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in order to keep out\n"
 "this frost?  Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the\n"
 "curbstone before the door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that\n"
 "an iceberg should be moored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself,\n"
 "he too lives like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and\n"
 "being a president of a temperance society, he only drinks the tepid\n"
 "tears of orphans.  But no more of this blubbering now, we are going\n"
 "a-whaling, and there is plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the\n"
 "ice from our frosted feet, and see what sort of a place this \"Spouter\"\n"
 "may be.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a\n"
 "wide, low, straggling entry with old- fashioned wainscots, reminding\n"
 "one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a\n"
 "very large oil-painting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced,\n"
 "that in the unequal cross-lights by which you viewed it, it was only\n"
 "by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful\n"
 "inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an\n"
 "understanding of its purpose. such unaccountable masses of shades and\n"
 "shadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist,\n"
 "in the time of the New England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos\n"
 "bewitched.  But by dint of much and earnest contemplation, and oft\n"
 "repeated ponderings, and especially by throwing open the little window\n"
 "towards the back of the entry, you at last come to the conclusion that\n"
 "such an idea, however wild, might not be altogether unwarranted.  But\n"
 "what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous,\n"
 "black mass of something hovering in the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " centre of the picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular\n"
 "lines floating in a nameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture\n"
 "truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort\n"
 "of indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that\n"
 "fairly froze you to it, till you involuntarily took an oath with\n"
 "yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant. Ever and\n"
 "anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would dart you through. -\n"
 "It's the Black Sea in a midnight gale. - It's the unnatural combat of\n"
 "the four primal elements. - It's a blasted heath. - It's a Hyperborean\n"
 "winter scene. - It's the breaking- up of the ice-bound stream of\n"
 "Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous\n"
 "something in the picture's midst.  That once found out, and all the\n"
 "rest were plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a\n"
 "gigantic fish? even the great Leviathan himself?  In fact, the\n"
 "artist's design seemed this: a final theory of my own, partly based\n"
 "upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom I\n"
 "conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner in a\n"
 "great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its\n"
 "three dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale,\n"
 "purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of\n"
 "impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.  The opposite wall of this\n"
 "entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and\n"
 "spears. Some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory\n"
 "saws; others were tufted with knots of human hair; and one was\n"
 "sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made\n"
 "in the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower. You shuddered as you\n"
 "gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have\n"
 "gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying\n"
 "implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons\n"
 "all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With this once\n"
 "long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill\n"
 "fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that harpoon - so\n"
 "like a corkscrew now - was flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a\n"
 "whale, years afterward slain off the Cape of Blanco. The original iron\n"
 "entered\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the\n"
 "body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last was found\n"
 "imbedded in the hump.  Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon\n"
 "low-arched way - cut through what in old times must have been a great\n"
 "central chimney with fire-places all round - you enter the public\n"
 "room. A still duskier place is this, with such low ponderous beams\n"
 "above, and such old wrinkled planks beneath, that you would almost\n"
 "fancy you trod some old craft's cockpits, especially of such a howling\n"
 "night, when this corner- anchored old ark rocked so furiously. On one\n"
 "side stood a long, low, shelf-like table covered with cracked glass\n"
 "cases, filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world's\n"
 "remotest nooks. Projecting from the further angle of the room stands a\n"
 "dark-looking den - the bar - a rude attempt at a Right Whale's\n"
 "head. Be that how it may, there stands the vast arched bone of the\n"
 "whale's jaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive beneath it.  within\n"
 "are shabby shelves, ranged round with old decanters, bottles, flasks;\n"
 "and in those jaws of swift destruction, like another cursed Jonah (by\n"
 "which name indeed they called him), bustles a little withered old man,\n"
 "who, for their money, dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death.\n"
 "Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though\n"
 "true cylinders without - within, the villainous green goggling glasses\n"
 "deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians\n"
 "rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads' goblets. Fill\n"
 "to this mark, and your charge is but a penny; to this a penny more;\n"
 "and so on to the full glass - the Cape Horn measure, which you may\n"
 "gulp down for a shilling.  Upon entering the place I found a number of\n"
 "young seamen gathered about a table, examining by a dim light divers\n"
 "specimens of skrimshander. I sought the landlord, and telling him I\n"
 "desired to be accommodated with a room, received for answer that his\n"
 "house was full - not a bed unoccupied. \"But avast,\" he added, tapping\n"
 "his forehead, \"you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer's\n"
 "blanket, have ye? I s'pose you are goin' a whalin', so you'd better\n"
 "get used to that sort of thing.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I\n"
 "should ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be,\n"
 "and that if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and\n"
 "the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander\n"
 "further about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with\n"
 "the half of any decent man's blanket.  \"I thought so. All right; take\n"
 "a seat. Supper? - you want supper? Supper 'll be ready directly.\"  I\n"
 "sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the\n"
 "Battery.  At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it\n"
 "with his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the\n"
 "space between his legs. he was trying his hand at a ship under full\n"
 "sail, but he didn't make much headway, I thought.  At last some four\n"
 "or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room.  It was\n"
 "cold as Iceland - no fire at all - the landlord said he couldn't\n"
 "afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a winding\n"
 "sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold to our\n"
 "lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the fare\n"
 "was of the most substantial kind - not only meat and potatoes, but\n"
 "dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a\n"
 "green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful\n"
 "manner.  \"My boy,\" said the landlord, \"you'll have the nightmare to a\n"
 "dead sartainty.\"  \"Landlord,\" I whispered, that aint the harpooneer,\n"
 "is it?\"  \"Oh, no,\" said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, \"the\n"
 "harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he\n"
 "don't - he eats nothing but steaks, and likes 'em rare.\"  \"The devil\n"
 "he does,\" says I. \"Where is that harpooneer? Is he here?\"  \"He'll be\n"
 "here afore long,\" was the answer.  I could not help it, but I began to\n"
 "feel suspicious of this \"dark complexioned\" harpooneer. At any rate, I\n"
 "made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep\n"
 "together, he must undress and get into bed before I did.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when,\n"
 "knowing not what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest\n"
 "of the evening as a looker on.  Presently a rioting noise was heard\n"
 "without. Starting up, the landlord cried, \"That's the Grampus's\n"
 "crew. I seed her reported in the offing this morning; a three years'\n"
 "voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now we'll have the latest news\n"
 "from the Feegees.\"  A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry;\n"
 "the door was flung open, and in rolled a wild set of mariners\n"
 "enough. Enveloped in their shaggy watch coats, and with their heads\n"
 "muffled in woollen comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and their\n"
 "beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from\n"
 "Labrador.  They had just landed from their boat, and this was the\n"
 "first house they entered.  No wonder, then, that they made a straight\n"
 "wake for the whale's mouth - the bar - when the wrinkled little old\n"
 "Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all round. One\n"
 "complained of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a\n"
 "pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign\n"
 "cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long\n"
 "standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the\n"
 "weather side of an ice- island.  The liquor soon mounted into their\n"
 "heads, as it generally does even with the arrantest topers newly\n"
 "landed from sea, and they began capering about most obstreperously.  I\n"
 "observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though he\n"
 "seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own\n"
 "sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise\n"
 "as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the sea-gods\n"
 "had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though but a\n"
 "sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I will\n"
 "here venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six feet\n"
 "in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I have\n"
 "seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and burnt,\n"
 "making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep\n"
 "shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to\n"
 "give him much joy. His voice at once announced\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I thought\n"
 "he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleganian Ridge in\n"
 "Virginia. When the revelry of his companions had mounted to its\n"
 "height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him\n"
 "till he became my comrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he\n"
 "was missed by his shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a\n"
 "huge favorite with them, they raised a cry of \"Bulkington! Bulkington!\n"
 "where's Bulkington?\" and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.\n"
 "It was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming almost\n"
 "supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate\n"
 "myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the\n"
 "entrance of the seamen.  No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In\n"
 "fact, you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother. I\n"
 "don't know how it is, but people like to be private when they are\n"
 "sleeping. And when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a\n"
 "strange inn, in a strange town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then\n"
 "your objections indefinitely multiply. Nor was there any earthly\n"
 "reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody\n"
 "else; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor\n"
 "Kings do ashore. To be sure they all sleep together in one apartment,\n"
 "but you have your own hammock, and cover yourself with your own\n"
 "blanket, and sleep in your own skin.  The more I pondered over this\n"
 "harpooneer, the more I abominated the thought of sleeping with him. It\n"
 "was fair to presume that being a harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as\n"
 "the case might be, would not be of the tidiest, certainly none of the\n"
 "finest. I began to twitch all over. Besides, it was getting late, and\n"
 "my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards. Suppose now,\n"
 "he should tumble in upon me at midnight - how could I tell from what\n"
 "vile hole he had been coming?  \"Landlord! I've changed my mind about\n"
 "that harpooneer. - I shan't sleep with him. I'll try the bench here.\"\n"
 "\"Just as you please; I'm sorry i cant spare ye a tablecloth for a\n"
 "mattress, and it's a plaguy rough board here\" - feeling of the knots\n"
 "and notches. \"But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I've\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " got a carpenter's plane there in the bar - wait, I say, and\n"
 "I'll make ye snug enough.\" So saying he procured the plane; and with\n"
 "his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench, vigorously set to\n"
 "planing away at my bed, the while grinning like an ape. The shavings\n"
 "flew right and left; till at last the plane-iron came bump against an\n"
 "indestructible knot. The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I\n"
 "told him for heaven's sake to quit - the bed was soft enough to suit\n"
 "me, and I did not know how all the planing in the world could make\n"
 "eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the shavings with another\n"
 "grin, and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the\n"
 "room, he went about his business, and left me in a brown study.  I now\n"
 "took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too short;\n"
 "but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too narrow,\n"
 "and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the\n"
 "planed one - so there was no yoking them. I then placed the first\n"
 "bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall, leaving\n"
 "a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I soon\n"
 "found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under\n"
 "the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all,\n"
 "especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from\n"
 "the window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in\n"
 "the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the\n"
 "night.  The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn't\n"
 "I steal a march on him - bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed,\n"
 "not to be wakened by the most violent knockings? it seemed no bad\n"
 "idea; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but\n"
 "what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the\n"
 "harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!\n"
 "Still, looking around me again, and seeing no possible chance of\n"
 "spending a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed, I began\n"
 "to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices\n"
 "against this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I'll wait awhile; he must\n"
 "be dropping in before long. I'll have a good look at him then, and\n"
 "perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after all - there's no\n"
 "telling.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos,\n"
 "and threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\n"
 "\"Landlord!\" said I, \"what sort of a chap is he - does he always keep\n"
 "such late hours?\" It was now hard upon twelve o'clock.  The landlord\n"
 "chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be mightily\n"
 "tickled at something beyond my comprehension. \"No,\" he answered,\n"
 "\"generally he's an early bird - airley to bed and airley to rise -\n"
 "yes, he's the bird what catches the worm. - But to-night he went out a\n"
 "peddling, you see, and I don't see what on airth keeps him so late,\n"
 "unless, may be, he can't sell his head.\"  \"Can't sell his head? - What\n"
 "sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me?\" getting into\n"
 "a towering rage. \"Do you pretend to say, landlord, that this\n"
 "harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday night, or rather\n"
 "Sunday morning, in peddling his head around this town?\"  \"That's\n"
 "precisely it,\" said the landlord, \"and I told him he couldn't sell it\n"
 "here, the market's overstocked.\"  \"With what?\" shouted I.  \"With heads\n"
 "to be sure; ain't there too many heads in the world?\"  \"I tell you\n"
 "what it is, landlord,\" said I, quite calmly, \"you'd better stop\n"
 "spinning that yarn to me - I'm not green.\"  \"May be not,\" taking out a\n"
 "stick and whittling a toothpick, \"but I rayther guess you'll be done\n"
 "brown if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin' his head.\"  \"I'll\n"
 "break it for him,\" said I, now flying into a passion again at this\n"
 "unaccountable farrago of the landlord's.  \"It's broke a'ready,\" said\n"
 "he.  \"Broke,\" said I - \"broke, do you mean?\"  \"Sartain, and that's the\n"
 "very reason he can't sell it, I guess.\"  \"Landlord,\" said I, going up\n"
 "to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a snow storm, - \"landlord, stop\n"
 "whittling. You and I must understand one another, and that too without\n"
 "delay. I come to your house and want a bed; you tell me you can only\n"
 "give me half a one; that the other half belongs to a certain\n"
 "harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have not yet seen, you\n"
 "persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories,\n"
 "tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " you design for my bedfellow - a sort of connexion, landlord,\n"
 "which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree. I now\n"
 "demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer\n"
 "is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the night\n"
 "with him. And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay that\n"
 "story about selling his head, which if true I take to be good evidence\n"
 "that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I've no idea of sleeping with a\n"
 "madman; and you, sir, you I mean, landlord, you, sir, by trying to\n"
 "induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render yourself liable to\n"
 "a criminal prosecution.\"  \"Wall,\" said the landlord, fetching a long\n"
 "breath, \"that's a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now\n"
 "and then. But be easy, be easy, this here harpooneer I have been\n"
 "tellin' you of has just arrived from the south seas, where he bought\n"
 "up a lot of 'balmed New Zealand heads (great curios, you know), and\n"
 "he's sold all on 'em but one, and that one he's trying to sell\n"
 "to-night, cause to-morrow's Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin'\n"
 "human heads about the streets when folks is goin' to churches. He\n"
 "wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as he was goin' out of\n"
 "the door with four heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a\n"
 "string of inions.\"  This account cleared up the otherwise\n"
 "unaccountable mystery, and showed that the landlord, after all, had\n"
 "had no idea of fooling me - but at the same time what could I think of\n"
 "a harpooneer who stayed out a Saturday night clean into the holy\n"
 "Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of\n"
 "dead idolators?  \"Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a\n"
 "dangerous man.\"  \"He pays reg'lar,\" was the rejoinder. \"But come, it's\n"
 "getting dreadful late, you had better be turning flukes - it's a nice\n"
 "bed: Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were\n"
 "spliced. There's plenty room for two to kick about in that bed; it's\n"
 "an almighty big bed that. Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put\n"
 "our Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it. But I got a dreaming and\n"
 "sprawling about one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor,\n"
 "and came near breaking his arm. After\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " that, Sal said it wouldn't do. Come along here, I'll give ye a\n"
 "glim in a jiffy;\" and so saying he lighted a candle and held it\n"
 "towards me, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when\n"
 "looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed \"I vum it's Sunday -\n"
 "you won't see that harpooneer to-night; he's come to anchor somewhere\n"
 "- come along then; do come; won't ye come?\"  I considered the matter a\n"
 "moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was ushered into a small\n"
 "room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough, with a prodigious\n"
 "bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep\n"
 "abreast.  \"There,\" said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy\n"
 "old sea chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table;\n"
 "\"there, make yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.\" I turned\n"
 "round from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.  Folding back the\n"
 "counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of the most elegant,\n"
 "it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then glanced round the\n"
 "room; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see no other\n"
 "furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four walls,\n"
 "and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale. Of things\n"
 "not properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed up, and\n"
 "thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a large seaman's bag,\n"
 "containing the harpooneer's wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land\n"
 "trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on\n"
 "the shelf over the fire- place, and a tall harpoon standing at the\n"
 "head of the bed.  But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and\n"
 "held it close to the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every\n"
 "way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning\n"
 "it. I can compare it to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at\n"
 "the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained\n"
 "porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in\n"
 "the middle of this mat, as you see the same in South American\n"
 "ponchos. But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get\n"
 "into a door mat, and parade the streets of any Christian town in that\n"
 "sort of guise? I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a\n"
 "hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little\n"
 "damp, as though this\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I\n"
 "went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never\n"
 "saw such a sight in my life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry\n"
 "that I gave myself a kink in the neck.  I sat down on the side of the\n"
 "bed, and commenced thinking about this head- peddling harpooneer, and\n"
 "his door mat. After thinking some time on the bed-side, I got up and\n"
 "took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in the middle of the room\n"
 "thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a little more in my\n"
 "shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now, half undressed as\n"
 "I was, and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer's\n"
 "not coming home at all that night, it being so very late, I made no\n"
 "more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing\n"
 "out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the care of\n"
 "heaven.  Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken\n"
 "crockery, there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and\n"
 "could not sleep for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze,\n"
 "and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when\n"
 "I heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light\n"
 "come into the room from under the door.  Lord save me, thinks I, that\n"
 "must be the harpooneer, the infernal head-peddler.  But I lay\n"
 "perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word till spoken to.\n"
 "Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New Zealand head in\n"
 "the other, the stranger entered the room, and without looking towards\n"
 "the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one\n"
 "corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large\n"
 "bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was all eagerness to see\n"
 "his face, but he kept it averted for some time while employed in\n"
 "unlacing the bag's mouth. This accomplished, however, he turned round\n"
 "- when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was of a dark\n"
 "purplish, yellow color, here and there stuck over with large, blackish\n"
 "looking squares. Yes, it's just as I thought, he's a terrible\n"
 "bedfellow; he's been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is,\n"
 "just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his face\n"
 "so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be\n"
 "sticking-plasters at all,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " those black squares on his cheeks. they were stains of some\n"
 "sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an\n"
 "inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story of a white\n"
 "man - a whaleman too - who, falling among the cannibals, had been\n"
 "tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of\n"
 "his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And what\n"
 "is it, thought I, after all! It's only his outside; a man can be\n"
 "honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly\n"
 "complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely\n"
 "independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be\n"
 "nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a\n"
 "hot sun's tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one.  However, I\n"
 "had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced\n"
 "these extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas\n"
 "were passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed\n"
 "me at all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he\n"
 "commenced fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk,\n"
 "and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old\n"
 "chest in the middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head - a\n"
 "ghastly thing enough - and crammed it down into the bag. He now took\n"
 "off his hat - a new beaver hat - when I came nigh singing out with\n"
 "fresh surprise. There was no hair on his head - none to speak of at\n"
 "least - nothing but a small scalp- knot twisted up on his\n"
 "forehead. His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a\n"
 "mildewed skull. Had not the stranger stood between me and the door, I\n"
 "would have bolted out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.  Even\n"
 "as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but it\n"
 "was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this\n"
 "head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my\n"
 "comprehension. Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely\n"
 "nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, i confess i was now as\n"
 "much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken\n"
 "into my room at the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him\n"
 "that I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a\n"
 "satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at\n"
 "last showed his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him\n"
 "were checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was\n"
 "all over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty\n"
 "Years' War, and just escaped from it with a sticking- plaster\n"
 "shirt. Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark\n"
 "green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms. It was now\n"
 "quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped\n"
 "aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this\n"
 "Christian country. I quaked to think of it. A peddler of heads too -\n"
 "perhaps the heads of his own brothers. He might take a fancy to mine -\n"
 "heavens! look at that tomahawk!  But there was no time for shuddering,\n"
 "for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my\n"
 "attention, and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen. Going to\n"
 "his heavy grego, or wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously\n"
 "hung on a chair, he fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a\n"
 "curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly\n"
 "the color of a three days' old Congo baby. Remembering the embalmed\n"
 "head, at first I almost thought that this black manikin was a real\n"
 "baby preserved in some similar manner. But seeing that it was not at\n"
 "all limber, and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I\n"
 "concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it\n"
 "proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the empty fireplace, and\n"
 "removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunchbacked\n"
 "image, like a tenpin, between the andirons. the chimney jambs and all\n"
 "the bricks inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place\n"
 "made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.  I\n"
 "now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but\n"
 "ill at ease meantime - to see what was next to follow. First he takes\n"
 "about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places\n"
 "them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on\n"
 "top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into\n"
 "a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the\n"
 "fire, and still hastier\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be scorching\n"
 "them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit; then\n"
 "blow)ng off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of it\n"
 "to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such\n"
 "dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these strange\n"
 "antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the\n"
 "devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some\n"
 "pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in the\n"
 "most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the\n"
 "idol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket\n"
 "as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.  All\n"
 "these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing him\n"
 "now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations,\n"
 "and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time, now or\n"
 "never, before the light was put out, to break the spell into which I\n"
 "had so long been bound.  But the interval I spent in deliberating what\n"
 "to say, was a fatal one. Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he\n"
 "examined the head of it for an instant, and then holding it to the\n"
 "light, with his mouth at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of\n"
 "tobacco smoke. The next moment the light was extinguished, and this\n"
 "wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I\n"
 "sang out, I could not help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of\n"
 "astonishment he began feeling me.  Stammering out something, I knew\n"
 "not what, I rolled away from him against the wall, and then conjured\n"
 "him, whoever or whatever he might be, to keep quiet, and let me get up\n"
 "and light the lamp again. But his guttural responses satisfied me at\n"
 "once that he but ill comprehended my meaning.  \"Who-e debel you?\" - he\n"
 "at last said - \"you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.\" And so saying the\n"
 "lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark.  \"Landlord,\n"
 "for God's sake, Peter Coffin!\" shouted I. \"Landlord! Watch! Coffin!\n"
 "Angels! save me!\"  \"Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam- me, I\n"
 "kill-e!\" again growled the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of\n"
 "the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " my linen would get on fire. But thank heaven, at that moment\n"
 "the landlord came into the room light in hand, and leaping from the\n"
 "bed I ran up to him.  \"Don't be afraid now,\" said he, grinning\n"
 "again. \"Queequeg here wouldn't harm a hair of your head.\"  \"Stop your\n"
 "grinning,\" shouted I, \"and why didn't you tell me that that infernal\n"
 "harpooneer was a cannibal?\"  \"I thought ye know'd it; - didn't I tell\n"
 "ye, he was peddlin' heads around town?  - but turn flukes again and go\n"
 "to sleep. Queequeg, look here - you sabbee me, I sabbee you - this man\n"
 "sleepe you - you sabbee?\" - \"Me sabbee plenty\" - grunted Queequeg,\n"
 "puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed.  \"You gettee in,\" he\n"
 "added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and throwing the clothes to\n"
 "one side. He really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and\n"
 "charitable way. I stood looking at him a moment. For all his\n"
 "tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely looking\n"
 "cannibal. What's all this fuss I have been making about, thought i to\n"
 "myself - the man's a human being just as I am: he has just as much\n"
 "reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep with a\n"
 "sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.  \"Landlord,\" said I, \"tell\n"
 "him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or whatever you call it;\n"
 "tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will turn in with him.  But\n"
 "I don't fancy having a man smoking in bed with me. It's\n"
 "dangerous. Besides, I aint insured.\"  This being told to Queequeg, he\n"
 "at once complied, and again politely motioned me to get into bed -\n"
 "rolling over to one side as much as to say - I wont touch a leg of ye.\n"
 "\"Good night, landlord,\" said I, \"you may go.\"  I turned in, and never\n"
 "slept better in my life.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's\n"
 "arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had\n"
 "almost thought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork,\n"
 "full of odd little parti-colored squares and triangles; and this arm\n"
 "of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a\n"
 "figure, no two parts of which were of one precise shade - owing I\n"
 "suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade,\n"
 "his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times - this same\n"
 "arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same\n"
 "patchwork quilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I\n"
 "first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended\n"
 "their hues together; and it was only by the sense of weight and\n"
 "pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging me.  My\n"
 "sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a\n"
 "child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;\n"
 "whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely\n"
 "settle. The circumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or\n"
 "other - I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as i had seen a\n"
 "little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or\n"
 "other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,\n"
 "- my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me\n"
 "off to bed, though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon of the\n"
 "21st June, the longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt\n"
 "dreadfully. But there was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my\n"
 "little room in the third floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible\n"
 "so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.  I\n"
 "lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse\n"
 "before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " bed! the small of my back ached to think of it. And it was so\n"
 "light too; the sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of\n"
 "coaches in the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the\n"
 "house. I felt worse and worse - at last I got up, dressed, and softly\n"
 "going down in my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and\n"
 "suddenly threw myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular\n"
 "favor to give me a good slippering for my misbehavior; anything indeed\n"
 "but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time. But\n"
 "she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had\n"
 "to go to my room. For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a\n"
 "great deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest\n"
 "subsequent misfortunes. At last I must have fallen into a troubled\n"
 "nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it - half steeped in\n"
 "dreams - I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped\n"
 "in outer darkness. Instantly I felt a shock running through all my\n"
 "frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a\n"
 "supernatural hand seemed placed in mine. My arm hung over the\n"
 "counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom,\n"
 "to which the hand belonged, s%emed closely seated by my bedside. For\n"
 "what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most\n"
 "awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that\n"
 "if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be\n"
 "broken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me;\n"
 "but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and for\n"
 "days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding\n"
 "attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I often\n"
 "puzzle myself with it.  Now, take away the awful fear, and my\n"
 "sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar,\n"
 "in their strangeness, to those which I experienced on waking up and\n"
 "seeing Queequeg's pagan arm thrown round me. But at length all the\n"
 "past night's events soberly recurred, one by one, in fixed reality,\n"
 "and then I lay only alive to the comical predicament. For though I\n"
 "tried to move his arm - unlock his bridegroom clasp - yet, sleeping as\n"
 "he was, he still hugged me tightly, as though naught but death should\n"
 "part us twain. I now strove to rouse him -\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"Queequeg!\" - but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled\n"
 "over, my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly\n"
 "felt a slight scratch.  Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the\n"
 "tomahawk sleeping by the savage's side, as if it were a hatchet-faced\n"
 "baby. A pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house\n"
 "in the broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk!  \"Queequeg! - in the\n"
 "name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!\" At length, by dint of much\n"
 "wriggling, and loud and incessant expostulations upon the\n"
 "unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort\n"
 "of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew\n"
 "back his arm, shook himself all over like a Newfoundland dog just from\n"
 "the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me,\n"
 "and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how I came\n"
 "to be there, though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me\n"
 "seemed slowly dawning over him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him,\n"
 "having no serious misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly observing so\n"
 "curious a creature. When, at last, his mind seemed made up touching\n"
 "the character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled\n"
 "to the fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain signs and\n"
 "sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress\n"
 "first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole\n"
 "apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances, this\n"
 "is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages have an\n"
 "innate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous how\n"
 "essentially polite they are. I pay this particular compliment to\n"
 "Queequeg, because he treated me with so much civility and\n"
 "consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness; staring at him\n"
 "from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for the time my\n"
 "curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless, a man like\n"
 "Queequeg you don't see every day, he and his ways were well worth\n"
 "unusual regarding.  He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver\n"
 "hat, a very tall one, by the by, and then - still minus his trowsers -\n"
 "he hunted up his boots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot\n"
 "tell, but his next movement was to crush himself - boots in hand, and\n"
 "hat on - under the bed; when, from sundry violent\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " gaspings and strainings, I inferred he was hard at work\n"
 "booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I ever heard of,\n"
 "is any man required to be private when putting on his boots. But\n"
 "Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition state - neither\n"
 "caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized to show off\n"
 "his outlandishness in the strangest possible manner. his education was\n"
 "not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not been a small\n"
 "degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled himself\n"
 "with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage, he\n"
 "never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At\n"
 "last, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over\n"
 "his eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not\n"
 "being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide\n"
 "ones - probably not made to order either - rather pinched and\n"
 "tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning.  Seeing,\n"
 "now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the street\n"
 "being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view into the\n"
 "room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that Queequeg\n"
 "made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on; I\n"
 "begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and\n"
 "particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He\n"
 "complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the\n"
 "morning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my\n"
 "amazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his\n"
 "chest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a\n"
 "piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre-table, dipped it into\n"
 "water and commenced lathering his face. I was watching to see where he\n"
 "kept his razor, when lo and behold, he ta+es the harpoon from the bed\n"
 "corner, slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it\n"
 "a little on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the\n"
 "wall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his\n"
 "cheeks. Thinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers's best cutlery with a\n"
 "vengeance. Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I\n"
 "came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how\n"
 "exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly\n"
 "marched out of the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket,\n"
 "and sporting his harpoon like a marshal's baton.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " I quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room\n"
 "accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice\n"
 "towards him, though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the\n"
 "matter of my bedfellow.  However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing,\n"
 "and rather too scarce a good thing; the more's the pity. So, if any\n"
 "one man, in his own proper person, afford stuff for a good joke to\n"
 "anybody, let him not be backward, but let him cheerfully allow himself\n"
 "to spend and be spent in that way. And the man that has anything\n"
 "bountifully laughable about him, be sure there is more in that man\n"
 "than you perhaps think for.  The bar-room was now full of the boarders\n"
 "who had been dropping in the night previous, and whom I had not as yet\n"
 "had a good look at. They were nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and\n"
 "second mates, and third mates, and sea carpenters, and sea coopers,\n"
 "and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and\n"
 "brawny company, with bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing\n"
 "monkey jackets for morning gowns.  You could pretty plainly tell how\n"
 "long each one had been ashore. This young fellow's healthy cheek is\n"
 "like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and would seem to smell almost as\n"
 "musky; he cannot have been three days landed from his Indian\n"
 "voyage. That man next him looks a few shades lighter; you might say a\n"
 "touch of satin wood is in him. In the complexion of a third still\n"
 "lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly bleached withal; he doubtless has\n"
 "tarried whole weeks ashore. But who could show a cheek like\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Queequeg? which, barred with various tints, seemed like the\n"
 "Andes' western slope, to show forth in one array, contrasting\n"
 "climates, zone by zone.  \"Grub, ho!\" now cried the landlord, flinging\n"
 "open a door, and in we went to breakfast.  They say that men who have\n"
 "seen the world, thereby become quite at ease in manner, quite\n"
 "self-possessed in company. Not always, though: Ledyard, the great New\n"
 "England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch one; of all men, they\n"
 "possessed the least assurance in the parlor. But perhaps the mere\n"
 "crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or the\n"
 "taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in the negro heart of\n"
 "Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo's performances - this kind of\n"
 "travel, I say, may not be the very best mode of attaining a high\n"
 "social polish. Still, for the most part, that sort of thing is to be\n"
 "had anywhere.  These reflections just here are occasioned by the\n"
 "circumstance that after we were all seated at the table, and I was\n"
 "preparing to hear some good stories about whaling; to my no small\n"
 "surprise, nearly every man maintained a profound silence. And not only\n"
 "that, but they looked embarrassed. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs,\n"
 "many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great\n"
 "whales on the high seas - entire strangers to them - and duelled them\n"
 "dead without winking; and yet, here they sat at a social breakfast\n"
 "table - all of the same calling, all of kindred tastes - looking round\n"
 "as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight\n"
 "of some sheepfold among the Green Mountains. A curious sight; these\n"
 "bashful bears, these timid warrior whalemen!  But as for Queequeg -\n"
 "why, Queequeg sat there among them - at the head of the table, too, it\n"
 "so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I cannot say much for his\n"
 "breeding. His greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his\n"
 "bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him, and using it there\n"
 "without ceremony; reaching over the table with it, to the imminent\n"
 "jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks towards him. But\n"
 "that was certainly very coolly done by him, and every\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " one knows that in most people's estimation, to do anything\n"
 "coolly is to do it genteelly.  We will not speak of all Queequeg's\n"
 "peculiarities here; how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls, and applied\n"
 "his undivided attention to beefsteaks, done rare.  Enough, that when\n"
 "breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room,\n"
 "lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was sitting there quietly digesting and\n"
 "smoking with his inseparable hat on, when I sallied out for a stroll.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so\n"
 "outlandish an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite\n"
 "society of a civilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon\n"
 "taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford.\n"
 "In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will\n"
 "frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from\n"
 "foreign parts. Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean\n"
 "mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent street is\n"
 "not unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green,\n"
 "live Yankees have often scared the natives. But New Bedford beats all\n"
 "Water street and Wapping. In these last-mentioned haunts you see only\n"
 "sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street\n"
 "corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones\n"
 "unholy flesh.  It makes a stranger stare.  But, besides the Feegeeans,\n"
 "Tongatabooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians, and Brighggians, and,\n"
 "besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft which unheeded reel\n"
 "about the streets, you will see other sights still more curious,\n"
 "certainly more comical.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " There weekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters\n"
 "and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain and glory in the\n"
 "fishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames; fellows who have\n"
 "felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the\n"
 "whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they\n"
 "came. In some things you would think them but a few hours old. Look\n"
 "there! that chap strutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat and\n"
 "swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife. Here\n"
 "comes another with a sou'-wester and a bombazine cloak.  No town-bred\n"
 "dandy will compare with a country-bred one - I mean a downright\n"
 "bumpkin dandy - a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his two acres\n"
 "in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a country\n"
 "dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished\n"
 "reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the\n"
 "comical things he does upon reaching the seaport. In bespeaking his\n"
 "sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to his\n"
 "canvas trowsers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will burst those\n"
 "straps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps,\n"
 "buttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest.  But think not that\n"
 "this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals, and bumpkins to show\n"
 "her visitors. Not at all. Still New Bedford is a queer place.  Had it\n"
 "not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would this day perhaps\n"
 "have been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador. As it is,\n"
 "parts of her back country are enough to frighten one, they look so\n"
 "bony. The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in, in all\n"
 "New England. It is a land of oil, true enough; but not like Canaan; a\n"
 "land, also, of corn and wine. The streets do not run with milk; nor in\n"
 "the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs.  Yet, in spite of\n"
 "this, nowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like houses;\n"
 "parks and gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford. Whence came they?\n"
 "how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country?  Go and gaze\n"
 "upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion, and\n"
 "your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave houses and\n"
 "flowery gardens came from the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. One and all, they were\n"
 "harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea. Can Herr\n"
 "Alexander perform a feat like that?  In New Bedford, fathers, they\n"
 "say, give whales for dowers to their daughters, and portion off their\n"
 "nieces with a few porpoises a- piece. You must go to New Bedford to\n"
 "see a brilliant wedding; for, they say, they have reservoirs of oil in\n"
 "every house, and every night recklessly burn their lengths in\n"
 "spermaceti candles.  In summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of\n"
 "fine maples - long avenues of green and gold. And in August, high in\n"
 "air, the beautiful and bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise,\n"
 "proffer the passer-by their tapering upright cones of congregated\n"
 "blossoms. So omnipotent is art; which in many a district of New\n"
 "Bedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren\n"
 "refuse rocks thrown aside at creation's final day.  And the women of\n"
 "New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. But roses only bloom\n"
 "in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as\n"
 "sunlight in the seventh heavens. Elsewhere match that bloom of theirs,\n"
 "ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell me the young girls breathe\n"
 "such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore, as\n"
 "though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the\n"
 "Puritanic sands.  In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman's\n"
 "Chapel, and few are the moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian\n"
 "Ocean or Pacific, who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot. I am\n"
 "sure that I did not.  Returning from my first morning stroll, I again\n"
 "sallied out upon this special errand. The sky had changed from clear,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " sunny cold, to driving sleet and mist. Wrapping myself in my\n"
 "shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin, I fought my way against\n"
 "the stubborn storm. Entering, I found a small scattered congregation\n"
 "of sailors, and sailors' wives and widows. A muffled silence reigned,\n"
 "only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm. Each silent\n"
 "worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other, as if each\n"
 "silent grief were insular and incommunicable. The chaplain had not yet\n"
 "arrived; and there these silent islands of men and women sat\n"
 "steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets, with black borders, masoned\n"
 "into the wall on either side the pulpit. Three of them ran something\n"
 "like the following, but I do not pretend to quote: - Sacred To the\n"
 "Memory of JOHN TALBOT, Who, at the age of eighteen, was lost overboard\n"
 "Near the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia November 1st, 1986.  This\n"
 "Tablet Is erected to his Memory By his Sister.  Sacred To the Memory\n"
 "of ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN, WALTER CANNY, SETH\n"
 "MACY, AND SAMUEL GLEIG, Forming one of the boats' crews of the Ship\n"
 "Eliza Who were towed out of sight by a Whale, On the Off-shore Ground\n"
 "in the Pacific, December 31st, 1839.  This Marble Is here placed by\n"
 "their surviving Shipmates.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Sacred To the Memory of The late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY,l.  Who\n"
 "in the bows of his boat was killed by al.  Sperm Whale on the coast of\n"
 "Japan, August 3rd, 1833.  This Tablet Is erected to his Memory by His\n"
 "Widow.  Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I\n"
 "seated myself near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see\n"
 "Queequeg near me. Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was a\n"
 "wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance. This\n"
 "savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance;\n"
 "because he was the only one who could not read, and, therefore, was\n"
 "not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall. Whether any of the\n"
 "relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the\n"
 "congregation, I knew not; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in\n"
 "the fishery, and so plainly did several women present wear the\n"
 "countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief, that I feel\n"
 "sure that here before me were assembled those, in whose unhealing\n"
 "hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old\n"
 "wounds to bleed afresh.  Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the\n"
 "green grass; who standing among flowers can say - here, here lies my\n"
 "beloved; ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like\n"
 "these. What bitter blanks in those black-bordered marbles which cover\n"
 "no ashes! What despair in those immovable inscriptions! What deadly\n"
 "voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon\n"
 "all Faith, and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly\n"
 "perished without a grave. As well might those tablets stand in the\n"
 "cave of Elephanta as here.  In what census of living creatures, the\n"
 "dead of mankind are included; why it is that a universal proverb says\n"
 "of them, that\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " they tell no tales, though containing more secrets than the\n"
 "Goodwin Sands; how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for\n"
 "the other world, we prefix so significant and infidel a word, and yet\n"
 "do not thus entitle him, if he but embarks for the remotest Indies of\n"
 "this living earth; why the Life Insurance Companies pay death-\n"
 "forfeitures upon immortals; in what eternal, unstirring paralysis, and\n"
 "deadly, hopeless trance, yet lies antique Adam who died sixty round\n"
 "centuries ago; how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for\n"
 "those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss;\n"
 "why all the living so strive to hush all the dead; wherefore but the\n"
 "rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city. All these\n"
 "things are not without their meanings.  But Faith, like a jackal,\n"
 "feeds among the tombs, and even from these dead doubts she gathers her\n"
 "most vital hope.  It needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on\n"
 "the eve of a Nantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by\n"
 "the murky light of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the\n"
 "whalemen who had gone before me, Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be\n"
 "thine. But somehow I grew merry again. Delightful inducements to\n"
 "embark, fine chance for promotion, it seems - aye, a stove boat will\n"
 "make me an immortal by brevet. Yes, there is death in this business of\n"
 "whaling - a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into\n"
 "Eternity. But what then? Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter\n"
 "of Life and Death. Methinks that what they call my shadow here on\n"
 "earth is my true substance. Methinks that in looking at things\n"
 "spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the\n"
 "water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air. Methinks my\n"
 "body is but the lees of my better being. In fact take my body who\n"
 "will, take it I say, it is not me. And therefore three cheers for\n"
 "Nantucket; and come a stove boat and stove body when they will, for\n"
 "stave my soul, Jove himself cannot.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain\n"
 "venerable robustness entered; immediately as the storm- pelted door\n"
 "flew back upon admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all\n"
 "the congregation, sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the\n"
 "chaplain. Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the\n"
 "whalemen, among whom he was a very great favorite. He had been a\n"
 "sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had\n"
 "dedicated his life to the ministry. At the time I now write of, Father\n"
 "Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort of old\n"
 "age which seems merging into a second flowering youth, for among all\n"
 "the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild gleams of a\n"
 "newly developing bloom - the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath\n"
 "February's snow. No one having previously heard his history, could for\n"
 "the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest,\n"
 "because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him,\n"
 "imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led. When he\n"
 "entered I observed that he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not\n"
 "come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting\n"
 "sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to\n"
 "the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed. However, hat\n"
 "and coat and overshoes were one by one removed, and hung up in a\n"
 "little space in an adjacent corner; when, arrayed in a decent suit, he\n"
 "quietly approached the pulpit.  Like most old fashioned pulpits, it\n"
 "was a very lofty one, and since a regular stairs to such a height\n"
 "would, by its long angle with the floor, seriously contract the\n"
 "already small area of the chapel, the architect, it seemed, had acted\n"
 "upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the pulpit without a\n"
 "stairs, substituting a perpendicular side ladder, like those used in\n"
 "mounting\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " a ship from a boat at sea. The wife of a whaling captain had\n"
 "provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for\n"
 "this ladder, which, being itself nicely headed, and stained with a\n"
 "mahogany color, the whole contrivance, considering what manner of\n"
 "chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad taste.  Halting for an\n"
 "instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both hands grasping the\n"
 "ornamental knobs of the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards,\n"
 "and then with a truly sailorlike but still reverential dexterity, hand\n"
 "over hand, mounted the steps as if ascending the main-top of his\n"
 "vessel.  The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually\n"
 "the case with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the\n"
 "rounds were of wood, so that at every step there was a joint. At my\n"
 "first glimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however\n"
 "convenient for a ship, these joints in the present instance seemed\n"
 "unnecessary. For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining\n"
 "the height, slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit,\n"
 "deliberately drag up the ladder step by step, till the whole was\n"
 "deposited within, leaving him impregnable in his little Quebec.  I\n"
 "pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for\n"
 "this. Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and\n"
 "sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any\n"
 "mere tricks of the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober\n"
 "reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something\n"
 "unseen. Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he\n"
 "signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward\n"
 "worldly ties and connexions? Yes, for replenished with the meat and\n"
 "wine of the word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a\n"
 "self- containing stronghold - a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a\n"
 "perennial well of water within the walls.  But the side ladder was not\n"
 "the only strange feature of the place, borrowed from the chaplain's\n"
 "former sea-farings. Between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the\n"
 "pulpit, the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large\n"
 "painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm\n"
 "off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers. But high above the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there floated a little\n"
 "isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel's face; and this\n"
 "bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship's tossed\n"
 "deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into the Victory's\n"
 "plank where Nelson fell. \"Ah, noble ship,\" the angel seemed to say,\n"
 "\"beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the\n"
 "sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling off - serenest azure\n"
 "is at hand.\"  Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same\n"
 "sea-taste that had achieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled\n"
 "front was in the likeness of a ship's bluff bows, and the Holy Bible\n"
 "rested on the projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a\n"
 "ship's fiddle-headed beak.  What could be more full of meaning? - for\n"
 "the pulpit is ever this earth's foremost part; all the rest comes in\n"
 "its rear; the pulpit leads the world. From thence it is the storm of\n"
 "God's quick wrath is first descried, and the bow must bear the\n"
 "earliest brunt. From thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is\n"
 "first invoked for favorable winds. Yes, the world's a ship on its\n"
 "passage out, and not a voyage complete; and the pulpit is its prow.\n"
 "Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority\n"
 "ordered the scattered people to condense. \"Starboard gangway, there!\n"
 "side away to larboard - larboard gangway to starboard! Midships!\n"
 "midships!\"  There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the\n"
 "benches, and a still slighter shuffling of women's shoes, and all was\n"
 "quiet again, and every eye on the preacher.  He paused a little; then\n"
 "kneeling in the pulpit's bows, folded his large brown hands across his\n"
 "chest, uplifted his closed eyes,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling\n"
 "and praying at the bottom of the sea.  This ended, in prolonged solemn\n"
 "tones, like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is\n"
 "foundering at sea in a fog - in such tones he commenced reading the\n"
 "following hymn; but changing his manner towards the concluding\n"
 "stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy - \"The ribs and\n"
 "terrors in the whale, Arched over me a dismal gloom, While all God's\n"
 "sun-lit waves rolled by, And lift me deepening down to doom.  \"I saw\n"
 "the opening maw of hell, With endless pains and sorrows there; Which\n"
 "none but they that feel can tell - Oh, I was plunging to despair.  \"In\n"
 "black distress, I called my God, When I could scarce believe him mine,\n"
 "He bowed his ear to my complaints - No more the whale did me confine.\n"
 "With speed he flew to my relief, As on a radiant dolphin borne; Awful,\n"
 "yet bright, as lightning shone The face of my Deliverer God.  \"My song\n"
 "for ever shall record That terrible, that joyful hour; I give the\n"
 "glory to my God, His all the mercy and the power.\"  Nearly all joined\n"
 "in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the howling of the\n"
 "storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned over the\n"
 "leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon the\n"
 "proper page, said: \"Beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the\n"
 "first chapter of Jonah - \"And God had prepared a great fish to swallow\n"
 "up Jonah.\"  \"Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters -\n"
 "four yarns - is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the\n"
 "Scriptures. Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah's deep sealine\n"
 "sound! what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet! What\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " a noble thing is that canticle in the fish's belly! How\n"
 "billow- like and boisterously grand! We feel the floods surging over\n"
 "us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters; sea-weed and\n"
 "all the slime of the sea is about us!  But what is this lesson that\n"
 "the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a two- stranded lesson; a\n"
 "lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the\n"
 "living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it is a\n"
 "story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift\n"
 "punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy\n"
 "of Jonah.  As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of\n"
 "Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of God - never\n"
 "mind now what that command was, or how conveyed - which he found a\n"
 "hard command. But all the things that God would have us do are hard\n"
 "for us to do - remember that - and hence, he oftener commands us than\n"
 "endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves;\n"
 "and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of\n"
 "obeying God consists.  \"With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah\n"
 "still further flouts at God, by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks\n"
 "that a ship made by men, will carry him into countries where God does\n"
 "not reign, but only the Captains of this earth. He skulks about the\n"
 "wharves of Joppa, and seeks a ship that's bound for Tarshish.  There\n"
 "lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here. By all accounts\n"
 "Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz. That's\n"
 "the opinion of learned men. And where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in\n"
 "Spain; as far by water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have\n"
 "sailed in those ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown\n"
 "sea. Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most\n"
 "easterly coast of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz\n"
 "more than two thousand miles to the westward from that, just outside\n"
 "the Straits of Gibraltar. See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah\n"
 "sought to flee world-wide from God? Miserable man! Oh! most\n"
 "contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty\n"
 "eye, skulking from his God; prowling among the shipping like a vile\n"
 "burglar hastening to cross the seas. So disordered, self-condemning is\n"
 "his look, that had there been policemen in\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong,\n"
 "had been arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he's a fugitive!\n"
 "no baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag, - no friends\n"
 "accompany him to the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much\n"
 "dodging search, he finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of\n"
 "her cargo; and as he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin,\n"
 "all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to\n"
 "mark the stranger's evil eye. Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to\n"
 "look all ease and confidence; in vain essays his wretched\n"
 "smile. Strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no\n"
 "innocent. In their gamesome but still serious way, one whispers to the\n"
 "other - \"Jack, he's robbed a widow;\" or,\"Joe, do you mark him; he's a\n"
 "bigamist;\" or,\"Harry lad, I guess he's the adulterer that broke jail\n"
 "in old Gomorrah, or belike, one of the missing murderers from Sodom.\"\n"
 "Another runs to read the bill that's stuck against the spile upon the\n"
 "wharf to which the ship is moored, offering five hundred gold coins\n"
 "for the apprehension of a parricide, and containing a description of\n"
 "his person. He reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his\n"
 "sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their\n"
 "hands upon him. Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning all his\n"
 "boldness to his face, only looks so much the more a coward. He will\n"
 "not confess himself suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion. So\n"
 "he makes the best of it; and when the sailors find him not to be the\n"
 "man that is advertised, they let him pass, and he descends into the\n"
 "cabin.  \"\"Who's there?\" cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly\n"
 "making out his papers for the Customs - \"Who's there?\" Oh! how that\n"
 "harmless question mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to\n"
 "flee again. But he rallies. \"I seek a passage in this ship to\n"
 "Tarshish; how soon sail ye, sir?\" Thus far the busy captain had not\n"
 "looked up to Jonah, though the man now stands before him; but no\n"
 "sooner does he hear that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing\n"
 "glance. \"We sail with the next coming tide,\" at last he slowly\n"
 "answered, still intently eyeing him. \"No sooner, sir?\" - \"Soon enough\n"
 "for any honest man that goes a passenger.\" Ha! Jonah, that's another\n"
 "stab. But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent. \"I'll\n"
 "sail with ye,\" - he says, - \"the passage\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " money, how much is that, - I'll pay now.\" For it is\n"
 "particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing not to be\n"
 "overlooked in this history,\"that he paid the fare thereof\" ere the\n"
 "craft did sail. And taken with the context, this is full of meaning.\n"
 "\"Now Jonah's Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects\n"
 "crime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In\n"
 "this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and\n"
 "without a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all\n"
 "frontiers. So Jonah's Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah's\n"
 "purse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum;\n"
 "and it's assented to. Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive;\n"
 "but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear\n"
 "with gold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent\n"
 "suspicions still molest the Captain. He rings every coin to find a\n"
 "counterfeit. Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down\n"
 "for his passage. \"Point out my state-room, Sir,\" says Jonah now. \"I'm\n"
 "travel-weary; I need sleep.\" \"Thou look'st like it,\" says the Captain,\n"
 "\"there's thy room.\" Jonah enters, and would lock the door, but the\n"
 "lock contains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling there, the\n"
 "Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about the doors\n"
 "of convicts' cells being never allowed to be locked within. All\n"
 "dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and\n"
 "finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on his\n"
 "forehead. The air is close, and Jonah gasps. then, in that contracted\n"
 "hole, sunk, too, beneath the ship's water-line, Jonah feels the\n"
 "heralding presentiment of that stifling hour, when the whale shall\n"
 "hold him in the smallest of his bowel's wards.  \"Screwed at its axis\n"
 "against the side, a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in Jonah's room;\n"
 "and the ship, heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the\n"
 "last bales received, the lamp, flame and all, though in slight motion,\n"
 "still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room;\n"
 "though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it but made obvious the\n"
 "false, lying levels among which it hung. The lamp alarms and frightens\n"
 "Jonah; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place,\n"
 "and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless\n"
 "glance. But that contradiction in the lamp more and\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " more appals him. The floor, the ceiling, and the side, are all\n"
 "awry. \"Oh! so my conscience hangs in me!\" he groans, \"straight upward,\n"
 "so it burns; but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness!\"\n"
 "\"Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still\n"
 "reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the\n"
 "Roman race- horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him;\n"
 "as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy\n"
 "anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at\n"
 "last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as\n"
 "over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and\n"
 "there's naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth,\n"
 "Jonah's prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.\n"
 "\"And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and\n"
 "from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all\n"
 "careening, glides to sea.  That ship, my friends, was the first of\n"
 "recorded smugglers! the contraband was Jonah. but the sea rebels; he\n"
 "will not bear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship\n"
 "is like to break. But now when the boatswain calls all hands to\n"
 "lighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard;\n"
 "when the wind is shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank\n"
 "thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah's head; in all this\n"
 "raging tumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black sky\n"
 "and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or\n"
 "heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now with open\n"
 "mouth is cleaving the seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone\n"
 "down into the sides of the ship - a berth in the cabin as I have taken\n"
 "it, and was fast asleep. But the frightened master comes to him, and\n"
 "shrieks in his dead ear, \"What meanest thou, O sleeper! arise!\"\n"
 "Startled from his lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his\n"
 "feet, and stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the\n"
 "sea. But at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping\n"
 "over the bulwarks. Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship, and\n"
 "finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the mariners\n"
 "come nigh to drowning while yet afloat. And ever, as the white moon\n"
 "shows\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness\n"
 "overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward,\n"
 "but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep.  \"Terrors\n"
 "upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his cringing\n"
 "attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The sailors mark\n"
 "him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him, and at last,\n"
 "fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to high Heaven,\n"
 "they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this great tempest\n"
 "was upon them. The lot is Jonah's; that discovered, then how furiously\n"
 "they mob him with their questions. \"What is thine occupation? whence\n"
 "comest thou? thy country? what people?\" but mark now, my shipmates,\n"
 "the behavior of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask him who he is,\n"
 "and where from; whereas, they not only receive an answer to those\n"
 "questions, but likewise another answer to a question not put by them,\n"
 "but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of\n"
 "God that is upon him.  \"\"I am a Hebrew,\" he cries - and then - \"I fear\n"
 "the Lord the God of Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land!\"\n"
 "Fear him, O Jonah? Aye, well mightest thou fear the Lord God then!\n"
 "Straightway, he now goes on to make a full confession; whereupon the\n"
 "mariners became more and more appalled, but still are pitiful. For\n"
 "when Jonah, not yet supplicating God for mercy, since he but too well\n"
 "knew the darkness of his deserts, - when wretched Jonah cries out to\n"
 "them to take him and cast him forth into the sea, for he knew that for\n"
 "his sake this great tempest was upon them; they mercifully turn from\n"
 "him, and seek by other means to save the ship. But all in vain; the\n"
 "indignant gale howls louder; then, with one hand raised invokingly to\n"
 "God, with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.  \"And\n"
 "now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea; when\n"
 "instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea is\n"
 "still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water\n"
 "behind. He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless\n"
 "commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into\n"
 "the yawning jaws\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory teeth,\n"
 "like the Lord out of the fish's belly. But observe his prayer, and so\n"
 "many white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed unto learn a\n"
 "weighty lesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for\n"
 "direct deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is just. He\n"
 "leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting himself with this, that\n"
 "spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards His holy\n"
 "temple. And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance; not\n"
 "clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment. And how pleasing to\n"
 "God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in the eventual deliverance of\n"
 "him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I do not place Jonah before\n"
 "you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a model\n"
 "for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it like\n"
 "Jonah.\"  While he was speaking these words, the howling of the\n"
 "shrieking, slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the\n"
 "preacher, who, when describing Jonah's sea-storm, seemed tossed by a\n"
 "storm himself. His deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his\n"
 "tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work; and the thunders that\n"
 "rolled away from off his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his\n"
 "eye, made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that\n"
 "was strange to them.  There now came a lull in his look, as he\n"
 "silently turned over the leaves of the Book once more; and, at last,\n"
 "standing motionless, with closed eyes, for the moment, seemed\n"
 "communing with God and himself.  But again he leaned over towards the\n"
 "people, and bowing his head lowly, with an aspect of the deepest yet\n"
 "manliest humility, he spake these words: \"Shipmates, God has laid but\n"
 "one hand upon you; both his hands press upon me. I have read ye by\n"
 "what murky light may be mine the lesson that Jonah teaches to all\n"
 "sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to me, for I am a greater\n"
 "sinner than ye.  And now how gladly would I come down from this\n"
 "mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit, and listen as\n"
 "you listen, while some one of you reads me that other and more awful\n"
 "lesson which Jonah teaches to me as a pilot of\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the living God. How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or\n"
 "speaker of true things, and bidden by the Lord to sound those\n"
 "unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at\n"
 "the hostility he should raise, fled from his mission, and sought to\n"
 "escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa. But God is\n"
 "everywhere; Tarshish he never reached. As we have seen, God came upon\n"
 "him in the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom, and\n"
 "with swift slantings tore him along\"into the midst of the seas,\" where\n"
 "the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down, and\"the weeds\n"
 "were wrapped about his head,\" and all the watery world of woe bowled\n"
 "over him. Yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet - \"out of the\n"
 "belly of hell\" - when the whale grounded upon the ocean's utmost\n"
 "bones, even then, God heard the engulphed, repenting prophet when he\n"
 "cried. Then God spake unto the fish; and from the shuddering cold and\n"
 "blackness of the sea, the whale came breeching up towards the warm and\n"
 "pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and earth; and\"vomited out\n"
 "Jonah upon the dry land;\" when the word of the Lord came a second\n"
 "time; and Jonah, bruised and beaten - his ears, like two sea-shells,\n"
 "still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean - Jonah did the\n"
 "Almighty's bidding. And what was that, shipmates? To preach the Truth\n"
 "to the face of Falsehood! That was it!  \"This, shipmates, this is that\n"
 "other lesson; and woe to that pilot of the living God who slights\n"
 "it. Woe to him whom this world charms from Gospel duty! Woe to him who\n"
 "seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God has brewed them into a\n"
 "gale!  Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal! Woe to him\n"
 "whose good name is more to him than goodness! Woe to him who, in this\n"
 "world, courts not dishonor! Woe to him who would not be true, even\n"
 "though to be false were salvation! Yea, woe to him who, as the great\n"
 "Pilot Paul has it, while preaching to others is himself a castaway!\"\n"
 "He drooped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his\n"
 "face to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out\n"
 "with a heavenly enthusiasm, - \"But oh! shipmates! on the starboard\n"
 "hand of every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of that\n"
 "delight, than the bottom of the woe is\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " deep. Is not the main-truck higher than the kelson is low?\n"
 "Delight is to him - a far, far upward, and inward delight - who\n"
 "against the proud gods and commodores of this earth, ever stands forth\n"
 "his own inexorable self. Delight is to him whose strong arms yet\n"
 "support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone\n"
 "down beneath him. Delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the\n"
 "truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out\n"
 "from under the robes of Senators and Judges. Delight, - top-gallant\n"
 "delight is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his\n"
 "God, and is only a patriot to heaven. Delight is to him, whom all the\n"
 "waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake\n"
 "from this sure Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and deliciousness\n"
 "will be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final breath\n"
 "- O Father! - chiefly known to me by Thy rod - mortal or immortal,\n"
 "here I die. I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this world's,\n"
 "or mine own. Yet this is nothing; I leave eternity to Thee; for what\n"
 "is man that he should live out the lifetime of his God?\"  He said no\n"
 "more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with his\n"
 "hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had departed, and\n"
 "he was left alone in the place.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg\n"
 "there quite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction\n"
 "some time. He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on\n"
 "the stove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face\n"
 "that little negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a\n"
 "jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to\n"
 "himself in his heathenish way.  But being now interrupted, he put up\n"
 "the image; and pretty\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " soon, going to the table, took up a large book there, and\n"
 "placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate\n"
 "regularity; at every fiftieth page - as I fancied - stopping a moment,\n"
 "looking vacantly around him, and giving utterance to a long-drawn\n"
 "gurgling whistle of astonishment. He would then begin again at the\n"
 "next fifty; seeming to commence at number one each time, as though he\n"
 "could not count more than fifty, and it was only by such a large\n"
 "number of fifties being found together, that his astonishment at the\n"
 "multitude of pages was excited.  With much interest I sat watching\n"
 "him. Savage though he was, and hideously marred about the face - at\n"
 "least to my taste - his countenance yet had a something in it which\n"
 "was by no means disagreeable. You cannot hide the soul.  Through all\n"
 "his unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw the traces of a simple\n"
 "honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold, there\n"
 "seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils. And\n"
 "besides all this, there was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan,\n"
 "which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim. He looked like a\n"
 "man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor. Whether it\n"
 "was, too, that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in\n"
 "freer and brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise\n"
 "would, this I will not venture to decide; but certain it was his head\n"
 "was phrenologically an excellent one. It may seem ridiculous, but it\n"
 "reminded me of General Washington's head, as seen in the popular busts\n"
 "of him.  It had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from\n"
 "above the brows, which were likewise very projecting, like two long\n"
 "promontories thickly wooded on top. Queequeg was George Washington\n"
 "cannibalistically developed.  Whilst I was thus closely scanning him,\n"
 "half-pretending meanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the\n"
 "casement, he never heeded my presence, never troubled himself with so\n"
 "much as a single glance; but appeared wholly occupied with counting\n"
 "the pages of the marvellous book. Considering how sociably we had been\n"
 "sleeping together the night previous, and especially considering the\n"
 "affectionate arm I had found thrown over me upon waking in the\n"
 "morning, I thought this indifference of his\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " very strange. But savages are strange beings; at times you do\n"
 "not know exactly how to take them. At first they are overawing; their\n"
 "calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had\n"
 "noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little,\n"
 "with the other seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever;\n"
 "appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his\n"
 "acquaintances. All this struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon second\n"
 "thoughts, there was something almost sublime in it. Here was a man\n"
 "some twenty thousand miles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is\n"
 "- which was the only way he could get there - thrown among people as\n"
 "strange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter; and yet he\n"
 "seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the utmost serenity; content\n"
 "with his own companionship; always equal to himself. Surely this was a\n"
 "touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt he had never heard there was\n"
 "such a thing as that. But, perhaps, to be true philosophers, we\n"
 "mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving. So soon\n"
 "as I hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher,\n"
 "I conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman, he must have \"broken\n"
 "his digester.\"  As I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire\n"
 "burning low, in that mild stage when, after its first intensity has\n"
 "warmed the air, it then only glows to be looked at; the evening shades\n"
 "and phantoms gathering round the casements, and peering in upon us\n"
 "silent, solitary twain; the storm booming without in solemn swells; I\n"
 "began to be sensible of strange feelings. I felt a melting in me. No\n"
 "more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the\n"
 "wolfish world. This soothing savage had redeemed it. There he sat, his\n"
 "very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized\n"
 "hypocrisies and bland deceits. Wild he was; a very sight of sights to\n"
 "see; yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him. And\n"
 "those same things that would have repelled most others, they were the\n"
 "very magnets that thus drew me. I'll try a pagan friend, thought I,\n"
 "since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy. I drew my\n"
 "bench near him, and made some friendly signs and hints, doing my best\n"
 "to talk with him meanwhile. At first he little noticed these advances;\n"
 "but presently, upon my referring to his last\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " night's hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were\n"
 "again to be bedfellows. I told him yes; whereat I thought he looked\n"
 "pleased, perhaps a little complimented.  We then turned over the book\n"
 "together, and I endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the\n"
 "printing, and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it.  Thus I\n"
 "soon engaged his interest; and from that we went to jabbering the best\n"
 "we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous\n"
 "town. Soon I proposed a social smoke; and, producing his pouch and\n"
 "tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff. And then we sat exchanging\n"
 "puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it regularly passing\n"
 "between us.  If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in\n"
 "the Pagan's breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it\n"
 "out, and left us cronies. He seemed to take to me quite as naturally\n"
 "and unbiddenly as I to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed\n"
 "his forehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that\n"
 "henceforth we were married; meaning, in his country's phrase, that we\n"
 "were bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be. In\n"
 "a countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far\n"
 "too premature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple\n"
 "savage those old rules would not apply.  After supper, and another\n"
 "social chat and smoke, we went to our room together.  He made me a\n"
 "present of his embalmed head; took out his enormous tobacco wallet,\n"
 "and groping under the tobacco, drew out some thirty dollars in silver;\n"
 "then spreading them on the table, and mechanically dividing them into\n"
 "two equal portions, pushed one of them towards me, and said it was\n"
 "mine. I was going to remonstrate; but he silenced me by pouring them\n"
 "into my trowsers' pockets. I let them stay. He then went about his\n"
 "evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed the paper\n"
 "fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed anxious\n"
 "for me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I deliberated\n"
 "a moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or otherwise.\n"
 "I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible\n"
 "Presbyterian Church. How then could I unite with\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood? But what\n"
 "is worship?  thought I. Do you suppose now, Ishmael, that the\n"
 "magnanimous God of heaven and earth - pagans and all included - can\n"
 "possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood? Impossible!\n"
 "But what is worship? - to do the will of God - that is worship. And\n"
 "what is the will of God? - to do to my fellow man what I would have my\n"
 "fellow man to do to me - that is the will of God. Now, Queequeg is my\n"
 "fellow man. And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me? Why,\n"
 "unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of\n"
 "worship. consequently, i must then unite with him in his; ergo, I must\n"
 "turn idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped prop up the innocent\n"
 "little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg; salamed before\n"
 "him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that done, we undressed and\n"
 "went to bed, at peace with our own consciences and all the world.  But\n"
 "we did not go to sleep without some little chat.  How it is I know\n"
 "not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosures\n"
 "between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the very bottom of\n"
 "their souls to each other; and some old couples often lie and chat\n"
 "over old times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our hearts'\n"
 "honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg - a cosy, loving pair.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short\n"
 "intervals, and Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown\n"
 "tattooed legs over mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely\n"
 "sociable and free and easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our\n"
 "confabulations, what little nappishness remained in us altogether\n"
 "departed, and we felt like getting up again, though day-break was yet\n"
 "some way down the future.  Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so\n"
 "that our recumbent\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " position began to grow wearisome, and by little and little we\n"
 "found ourselves sitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning\n"
 "against the head-board with our four knees drawn up close together,\n"
 "and our two noses bending over them, as if our knee-pans were\n"
 "warming-pans. We felt very nice and snug, the more so since it was so\n"
 "chilly out of doors; indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there\n"
 "was no fire in the room. The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy\n"
 "bodily warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for there is no\n"
 "quality in this world that is not what it is merely by\n"
 "contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If you flatter yourself that you\n"
 "are all over comfortable, and have been so a long time, then you\n"
 "cannot be said to be comfortable any more. But if, like Queequeg and\n"
 "me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be\n"
 "slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general consciousness you\n"
 "feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm. For this reason a\n"
 "sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which is one\n"
 "of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. For the height of this sort\n"
 "of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and\n"
 "your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then there you lie like\n"
 "the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.  We had been\n"
 "sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at once I\n"
 "thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether by day\n"
 "or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always\n"
 "keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness of\n"
 "being in bed. Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright\n"
 "except his eyes be closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper\n"
 "element of our essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey\n"
 "part. Upon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and\n"
 "self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the\n"
 "unilluminated twelve-o'clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable\n"
 "revulsion.  Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that\n"
 "perhaps it were best to strike a light, seeing that we were so wide\n"
 "awake; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs\n"
 "from his Tomahawk. Be it said, that though I had felt such a strong\n"
 "repugnance to his smoking in\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the bed the night before, yet see how elastic our stiff\n"
 "prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them. For now I liked\n"
 "nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed,\n"
 "because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then. I no\n"
 "more felt unduly concerned for the landlord's policy of insurance. I\n"
 "was only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of\n"
 "sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend. With our shaggy\n"
 "jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed the Tomahawk from one\n"
 "to the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of\n"
 "smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp.  Whether it was\n"
 "that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant\n"
 "scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island; and, eager\n"
 "to hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He gladly\n"
 "complied. Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his\n"
 "words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar\n"
 "with his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story\n"
 "such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Queequeg was a native of Kokovoko, an island far away to the\n"
 "West and South. It is not down in any map; true places never are.\n"
 "When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a\n"
 "grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green\n"
 "sapling; even then, in Queequeg's ambitious soul, lurked a strong\n"
 "desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or\n"
 "two. His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest; and\n"
 "on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of\n"
 "unconquerable warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins - royal\n"
 "stuff; though\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he\n"
 "nourished in his untutored youth.  A Sag Harbor ship visited his\n"
 "father's bay, and Queequeg sought a passage to Christian lands. But\n"
 "the ship, having her full complement of seamen, spurned his suit; and\n"
 "not all the King his father's influence could prevail. But Queequeg\n"
 "vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled off to a distant strait,\n"
 "which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the\n"
 "island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other a low tongue of\n"
 "land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the\n"
 "water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with its\n"
 "prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and when\n"
 "the ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her side;\n"
 "with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe;\n"
 "climbed up the chains; and throwing himself at full length upon the\n"
 "deck, grappled a ringbolt there, and swore not to let it go, though\n"
 "hacked in pieces.  In vain the captain threatened to throw him\n"
 "overboard; suspended a cutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the\n"
 "son of a King, and Queequeg budged not.  Struck by his desperate\n"
 "dauntlessness, and his wild desire to visit Christendom, the captain\n"
 "at last relented, and told him he might make himself at home. But this\n"
 "fine young savage - this sea Prince of Wales, never saw the captain's\n"
 "cabin. They put him down among the sailors, and made a whaleman of\n"
 "him. But like Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign\n"
 "cities, Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might\n"
 "happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen. For\n"
 "at bottom - so he told me - he was actuated by a profound desire to\n"
 "learn among the Christians, the arts whereby to make his people still\n"
 "happier than they were; and more than that, still better than they\n"
 "were. But, alas! the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that\n"
 "even Christians could be both miserable and wicked; infinitely more\n"
 "so, than all his father's heathens. Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor;\n"
 "and seeing what the sailors did there; and then going on to Nantucket,\n"
 "and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also, poor\n"
 "Queequeg gave it up for lost. Thought he, it's a wicked world in all\n"
 "meridians; I'll die a pagan.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these\n"
 "Christians, wore their clothes, and tried to talk their\n"
 "gibberish. Hence the queer ways about him, though now some time from\n"
 "home.  By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back,\n"
 "and having a coronation; since he might now consider his father dead\n"
 "and gone, he being very old and feeble at the last accounts. He\n"
 "answered no, not yet; and added that he was fearful Christianity, or\n"
 "rather Christians, had unfitted him for ascending the pure and\n"
 "undefiled throne of thirty pagan Kings before him. But by and by, he\n"
 "said, he would return, - as soon as he felt himself baptized\n"
 "again. For the nonce, however, he proposed to sail about, and sow his\n"
 "wild oats in all four oceans. They had made a harpooneer of him, and\n"
 "that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now.  I asked him what might\n"
 "be his immediate purpose, touching his future movements.  He answered,\n"
 "to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon this, I told him that\n"
 "whaling was my own design, and informed him of my intention to sail\n"
 "out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port for an adventurous\n"
 "whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to accompany me to that\n"
 "island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the same watch, the same\n"
 "boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my every hap; with both\n"
 "my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of both worlds. To all\n"
 "this I joyously assented; for besides the affection I now felt for\n"
 "Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such, could not\n"
 "fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly\n"
 "ignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted with the\n"
 "sea, as known to merchant seamen.  His story being ended with his\n"
 "pipe's last dying puff, Queequeg embraced me, pressed his forehead\n"
 "against mine, and blowing out the light, we rolled over from each\n"
 "other, this way and that, and very soon were sleeping.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to\n"
 "a barber, for a block, I settled my own and comrade's bill; using,\n"
 "however, my comrade's money.  The grinning landlord, as well as the\n"
 "boarders, seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had\n"
 "sprung up between me and Queequeg - especially as Peter Coffin's cock\n"
 "and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me\n"
 "concerning the very person whom I now companied with.  We borrowed a\n"
 "wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own poor\n"
 "carpet-bag, and Queequeg's canvas sack and hammock, away we went down\n"
 "to \"the Moss,\" the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the\n"
 "wharf. As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so\n"
 "much - for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their\n"
 "streets, - but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But\n"
 "we heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and\n"
 "Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon\n"
 "barbs. I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him\n"
 "ashore, and whether all whaling ships did not find their own\n"
 "harpoons. To this, in substance, he replied, that though what I hinted\n"
 "was true enough, yet he had a particular affection for his own\n"
 "harpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal\n"
 "combat, and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales. In short, like\n"
 "many inland reapers and mowers, who go into the farmers' meadows armed\n"
 "with their own scythes - though in no wise obliged to furnished them -\n"
 "even so, Queequeg, for his own private reasons, preferred his own\n"
 "harpoon.  Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny\n"
 "story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag\n"
 "Harbor. The owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house. Not\n"
 "to seem ignorant about the thing - though in truth he was entirely so,\n"
 "concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow - Queequeg\n"
 "puts his chest upon it; lashes it fast; and then shoulders the barrow\n"
 "and marches up the wharf. \"Why,\" said I, \"Queequeg, you might have\n"
 "known better than that, one would think. Didn't the people laugh?\"\n"
 "Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of\n"
 "Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water\n"
 "of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and\n"
 "this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided\n"
 "mat where the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once\n"
 "touched at Rokovoko, and its commander - from all accounts, a very\n"
 "stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain - this\n"
 "commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg's sister, a\n"
 "pretty young princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding\n"
 "guests were assembled at the bride's bamboo cottage, this Captain\n"
 "marches in, and being assigned the post of honor, placed himself over\n"
 "against the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the\n"
 "King, Queequeg's father. Grace being said, - for those people have\n"
 "their grace as well as we - though Queequeg told me that unlike us,\n"
 "who at such times look downwards to our platters, they, on the\n"
 "contrary, copying the ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all\n"
 "feasts - Grace, I say, being said, the High Priest opens the banquet\n"
 "by the immemorial ceremony of the island; that is, dipping his\n"
 "consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed\n"
 "beverage circulates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest, and noting\n"
 "the ceremony, and thinking himself - being Captain of a ship - as\n"
 "having plain precedence over a mere island King, especially in the\n"
 "King's own house - the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in\n"
 "the punch bowl; - taking it i suppose for a huge finger-glass. \"Now,\"\n"
 "said Queequeg, \"what you tink now, - Didn't our people laugh?\"  At\n"
 "last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the schooner.\n"
 "Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " one side, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-\n"
 "covered trees all glittering in the clear, cold air. Huge hills and\n"
 "mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by\n"
 "side the world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at\n"
 "last; while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with\n"
 "blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening\n"
 "that new cruises were on the start; that one most perilous and long\n"
 "voyage ended, only begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a\n"
 "third, and so on, for ever and for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea,\n"
 "the intolerableness of all earthly effort.  Gaining the more open\n"
 "water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little Moss tossed the\n"
 "quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his snortings. How I snuffed\n"
 "that Tartar air! - how I spurned that turnpike earth! - that common\n"
 "highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs; and\n"
 "turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no\n"
 "records.  At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel\n"
 "with me. His dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and\n"
 "pointed teeth. On, on we flew, and our offing gained, the Moss did\n"
 "homage to the blast; ducked and dived her brows as a slave before the\n"
 "Sultan. Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling\n"
 "like a wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land\n"
 "tornadoes. So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the\n"
 "plunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering\n"
 "glances of the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that\n"
 "two fellow beings should be so companionable; as though a white man\n"
 "were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro. But there were\n"
 "some boobies and bumpkins there, who, by their intense greenness, must\n"
 "have come from the heart and centre of all verdure. Queequeg caught\n"
 "one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back. I thought\n"
 "the bumpkin's hour of doom was come. Dropping his harpoon, the brawny\n"
 "savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity\n"
 "and strength, sent him high up bodily into the air; then slightly\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with\n"
 "bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his back upon\n"
 "him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff.\n"
 "\"Capting! Capting!\" yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;\n"
 "\"Capting, Capting, here's the devil.\"  \"Hallo, you sir,\" cried the\n"
 "Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking up to Queequeg, \"what in\n"
 "thunder do you mean by that? Don't you know you might have killed that\n"
 "chap?\"  \"What him say?\" said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.  \"He\n"
 "say,\" said I, \"that you came near kill-e that man there,\" pointing to\n"
 "the still shivering greenhorn.  \"Kill-e,\" cried Queequeg, twisting his\n"
 "tattooed face into an unearthly expression of disdain, \"ah! him bevy\n"
 "small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e\n"
 "big whale!\"  \"Look you,\" roared the Captain, \"I'll kill-e you, you\n"
 "cannibal, if you try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your\n"
 "eye.\"  But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the\n"
 "Captain to mind his own eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail\n"
 "had parted the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying\n"
 "from side to side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the\n"
 "deck. The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept\n"
 "overboard; all hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the\n"
 "boom to stay it, seemed madness. It flew from right to left, and back\n"
 "again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on\n"
 "the point of snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing\n"
 "seemed capable of being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows,\n"
 "and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an\n"
 "exasperated whale. In the midst of this consternation, Queequeg\n"
 "dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under the path of the boom,\n"
 "whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks, and then\n"
 "flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as it swept\n"
 "over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way trapped,\n"
 "and all was safe.  The schooner was run into the wind, and while the\n"
 "hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to the\n"
 "waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap. For\n"
 "three\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing his\n"
 "long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his brawny\n"
 "shoulders through the freezing foam. I looked at the grand and\n"
 "glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved. The greenhorn had gone\n"
 "down. Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg now\n"
 "took an instant's glance around him, and seeming to see just how\n"
 "matters were, dived down and disappeared. A few minutes more, and he\n"
 "rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the other dragging a\n"
 "lifeless form. The boat soon picked them up. The poor bumpkin was\n"
 "restored. All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump; the captain begged\n"
 "his pardon. From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle; yea,\n"
 "till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.  Was there ever such\n"
 "unconsciousness? He did not seem to think that he at all deserved a\n"
 "medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He only asked for\n"
 "water - fresh water - something to wipe the brine off; that done, he\n"
 "put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the\n"
 "bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying to\n"
 "himself - \"It's a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We\n"
 "cannibals must help these Christians.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning;\n"
 "so, after a fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.  Nantucket! Take\n"
 "out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of the world it\n"
 "occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely than the\n"
 "Eddystone lighthouse. Look at it - a mere hillock, and elbow of sand;\n"
 "all beach, without a background. There is more sand there than you\n"
 "would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper. Some\n"
 "gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there,\n"
 "they don't\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " grow naturally; that they import Canada thistles; that they\n"
 "have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask;\n"
 "that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the\n"
 "true cross in Rome; that people there plant toadstools before their\n"
 "houses, to get under the shade in summer time; that one blade of grass\n"
 "makes an oasis, three blades in a day's walk a prairie; that they wear\n"
 "quicksand shoes, something like Laplander snowshoes; that they are so\n"
 "shut up, belted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an\n"
 "utter island of by the ocean, that to their very chairs and tables\n"
 "small clams will sometimes be found adhering, as to the backs of sea\n"
 "turtles. But these extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no\n"
 "Illinois.  Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this\n"
 "island was settled by the red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden\n"
 "times an eagle swooped down upon the New England coast, and carried\n"
 "off an infant Indian in his talons. With loud lament the parents saw\n"
 "their child borne out of sight over the wide waters. They resolved to\n"
 "follow in the same direction. Setting out in their canoes, after a\n"
 "perilous passage they discovered the island, and there they found an\n"
 "empty ivory casket, - the poor little Indian's skeleton.  What wonder,\n"
 "then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should take to the sea\n"
 "for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and quohogs in the sand;\n"
 "grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more experienced,\n"
 "they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last, launching a\n"
 "navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world; put an\n"
 "incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in at Behring's\n"
 "Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war\n"
 "with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood; most\n"
 "monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea Mastodon,\n"
 "clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that his very\n"
 "panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious\n"
 "assaults!  And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits,\n"
 "issuing from their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the\n"
 "watery world like so many Alexanders; parcelling out among\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " them the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, as the three\n"
 "pirate powers did Poland. Let America add Mexico to Texas, and pile\n"
 "Cuba upon Canada; let the English overswarm all India, and hang out\n"
 "their blazing banner from the sun; two thirds of this terraqueous\n"
 "globe are the Nantucketer's. For the sea is his; he owns it, as\n"
 "Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a right of way through\n"
 "it. Merchant ships are but extension bridges; armed ones but floating\n"
 "forts; even pirates and privateers, though following the sea as\n"
 "highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships, other fragments of\n"
 "the land like themselves, without seeking to draw their living from\n"
 "the bottomless deep itself. The Nantucketer, he alone resides and\n"
 "riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in\n"
 "ships; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation.  There\n"
 "is his home; there lies his business, which a noah's flood would not\n"
 "interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives\n"
 "on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves,\n"
 "he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows\n"
 "not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like\n"
 "another world, more strangely than the moon would to an\n"
 "Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and\n"
 "is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer,\n"
 "out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while\n"
 "under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came\n"
 "snugly to anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend\n"
 "to no business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The\n"
 "landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea\n"
 "Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all\n"
 "Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that cousin Hosea, as he\n"
 "called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he plainly hinted\n"
 "that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at the Try\n"
 "Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow\n"
 "warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the\n"
 "larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a\n"
 "corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the\n"
 "first man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his\n"
 "very much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg\n"
 "insisted that the yellow warehouse - our first point of departure -\n"
 "must be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter\n"
 "Coffin to say it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating\n"
 "about a little in the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable\n"
 "inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something which\n"
 "there was no mistaking.  Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and\n"
 "suspended by asses' ears, swung from the cross-trees of an old\n"
 "top-mast, planted in front of an old doorway. The horns of the\n"
 "cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so that this old\n"
 "top-mast looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was over\n"
 "sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I could not help\n"
 "staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of crick was in\n"
 "my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes, two of them,\n"
 "one for Queequeg, and one for me. It's ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my\n"
 "Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones staring at\n"
 "me in the whalemen's chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair of\n"
 "prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints\n"
 "touching Tophet?  I was called from these reflections by the sight of\n"
 "a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the\n"
 "porch of the inn, under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked\n"
 "much like an injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man\n"
 "in a purple woollen shirt.  \"Get along with ye,\" said she to the man,\n"
 "\"or I'll be combing ye!\"  \"Come on, Queequeg,\" said I, \"all\n"
 "right. There's Mrs. Hussey.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but\n"
 "leaving Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his\n"
 "affairs. Upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed,\n"
 "Mrs. Hussey, postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us\n"
 "into a little room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics\n"
 "of a recently concluded repast, turned round to us and said - \"Clam or\n"
 "Cod?\"  \"What's that about Cods, ma'am?\" said I, with much politeness.\n"
 "\"Clam or Cod?\" she repeated.  \"A clam for supper? a cold clam; is that\n"
 "what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?\" says I; \"but that's a rather cold and\n"
 "clammy reception in the winter time, ain't it, Mrs Hussey?\"  But being\n"
 "in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple shirt, who\n"
 "was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the\n"
 "word \"clam,\" Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the\n"
 "kitchen, and bawling out \"clam for two,\" disappeared.  \"Queequeg,\"\n"
 "said I, \"do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one\n"
 "clam?\"  However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie\n"
 "the apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking\n"
 "chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet\n"
 "friends! hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely\n"
 "bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted\n"
 "pork cut up into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and\n"
 "plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being\n"
 "sharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his\n"
 "favorite fishing food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly\n"
 "excellent, we despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a\n"
 "moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey's clam and cod announcement, I\n"
 "thought I would try a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door,\n"
 "I uttered the word \"cod\" with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In\n"
 "a few moments the savory steam came forth again, but with a different\n"
 "flavor, and in good time a fine cod- chowder was placed before us.  We\n"
 "resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " bowl, thinks I to myself, I wonder now if this here has any\n"
 "effect on the head?  What's that stultifying saying about\n"
 "chowder-headed people? \"But look, Queequeg, ain't that a live eel in\n"
 "your bowl? Where's your harpoon?\"  Fishiest of all fishy places was\n"
 "the Try Pots, which well deserved its name; for the pots there were\n"
 "always boiling chowders. Chowder for breakfast, and chowder for\n"
 "dinner, and chowder for supper, till you began to look for fish-bones\n"
 "coming through your clothes. The area before the house was paved with\n"
 "clam-shells. Mrs.  Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish\n"
 "vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old\n"
 "shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the milk, too, which I could\n"
 "not at all account for, till one morning happening to take a stroll\n"
 "along the beach among some fishermen's boats, I saw Hosea's brindled\n"
 "cow feeding on fish remnants, and marching along the sand with each\n"
 "foot in a cod's decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.\n"
 "Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey\n"
 "concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to\n"
 "precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded\n"
 "his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. \"Why not?\" said\n"
 "I; \"every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon - but why not?\"\n"
 "\"Because it's dangerous,\" says she. \"Ever since young Stiggs coming\n"
 "from that unfort'nt v'y'ge of his, when he was gone four years and a\n"
 "half, with only three barrels of ile, was found dead in my first floor\n"
 "back, with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no\n"
 "boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So,\n"
 "Mr. Queequeg\"(for she had learned his name), \"I will just take this\n"
 "here iron, and keep it for you till morning.  But the chowder; clam or\n"
 "cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?\"  \"Both,\" says I; \"and let's have a\n"
 "couple of smoked herring by way of variety.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my\n"
 "surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand,\n"
 "that he had been diligently consulting Yojo - the name of his black\n"
 "little god - and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and\n"
 "strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together\n"
 "among the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft;\n"
 "instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of\n"
 "the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed\n"
 "befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a\n"
 "vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light\n"
 "upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in\n"
 "that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present\n"
 "irrespective of Queequeg.  I have forgotten to mention that, in many\n"
 "things, Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo's\n"
 "judgment and surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with\n"
 "considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant\n"
 "well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his\n"
 "benevolent designs.  Now, this plan of Queequeg's, or rather Yojo's,\n"
 "touching the selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at\n"
 "all. I had not a little relied on Queequeg's sagacity to point out the\n"
 "whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all\n"
 "my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to\n"
 "acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a\n"
 "determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly\n"
 "settle that trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving\n"
 "Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom - for it seemed that\n"
 "it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation,\n"
 "and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " day; how it was I never could find out, for, though I applied\n"
 "myself to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and\n"
 "XXXIX Articles - leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe,\n"
 "and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I\n"
 "sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged sauntering and\n"
 "many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three ships up for\n"
 "three-years' voyages - The Devil-Dam the Tit- bit, and the Pequod.\n"
 "Devil- dam, I do not know the origin of; Tit-bit is obvious; Pequod,\n"
 "you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of\n"
 "Massachusetts Indians, now extinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and\n"
 "pryed about the Devil-Dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and,\n"
 "finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment,\n"
 "and then decided that this was the very ship for us.  You may have\n"
 "seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know; - squared-toed\n"
 "luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, and what\n"
 "not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as\n"
 "this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather\n"
 "small if anything; with an old fashioned claw-footed look about\n"
 "her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of\n"
 "all four oceans, her old hull's complexion was darkened like a French\n"
 "grenadier's, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable\n"
 "bows looked bearded. Her masts - cut somewhere on the coast of Japan,\n"
 "where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale - her masts\n"
 "stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of\n"
 "Cologne. Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the\n"
 "pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Beckett\n"
 "bled. But to all these her old antiquities, were added new and\n"
 "marvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that for more\n"
 "than half a century she had followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years\n"
 "her chief-mate, before he commanded another vessel of his own, and now\n"
 "a retired seaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod, -\n"
 "this old Peleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had built upon\n"
 "her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness\n"
 "both of material and device, unmatched by anything except it be\n"
 "Thorkill-Hake's carved buckler or bedstead. She was\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy\n"
 "with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A\n"
 "cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her\n"
 "enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like\n"
 "one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the Sperm Whale,\n"
 "inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons\n"
 "to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly\n"
 "travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her\n"
 "reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one\n"
 "mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her\n"
 "hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest,\n"
 "felt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching\n"
 "its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble\n"
 "things are touched with that.  Now when I looked about the\n"
 "quarter-deck, for some one having authority, in order to propose\n"
 "myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw nobody; but I\n"
 "could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather wigwam,\n"
 "pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only a temporary\n"
 "erection used in port.  It was of a conical shape, some ten feet high;\n"
 "consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the\n"
 "middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale. Planted with\n"
 "their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced together,\n"
 "mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in a tufted\n"
 "point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like a top-knot\n"
 "on some old Pottowotamie Sachem's head. A triangular opening faced\n"
 "towards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete\n"
 "view forward.  And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length\n"
 "found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it\n"
 "being noon, and the ship's work suspended, was now enjoying respite\n"
 "from the burden of command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken\n"
 "chair, wriggling all over with curious carving; and the bottom of\n"
 "which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of\n"
 "which the wigwam was constructed.  There was nothing so very\n"
 "particular, perhaps, about the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " appearance of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny,\n"
 "like most old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut\n"
 "in the Quaker style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic\n"
 "net-work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which\n"
 "must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and\n"
 "always looking to windward; - for this causes the muscles about the\n"
 "eyes to become pursed together. Such eye- wrinkles are very effectual\n"
 "in a scowl.  \"Is this the Captain of the Pequod?\" said I, advancing to\n"
 "the door of the tent.  \"Supposing it be the Captain of the Pequod,\n"
 "what dost thou want of him?\" he demanded.  \"I was thinking of\n"
 "shipping.\"  \"Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou are no Nantucketer -\n"
 "ever been in a stove boat?\"  \"No, Sir, I never have.\"  \"Dost know\n"
 "nothing at all about whaling, I dare say - eh?\"  \"Nothing, Sir; but I\n"
 "have no doubt I shall soon learn. I've been several voyages in the\n"
 "merchant service, and I think that - \" \"Marchant service be\n"
 "damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that leg? - I'll take that\n"
 "leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of the marchant service\n"
 "to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now ye feel\n"
 "considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships. But\n"
 "flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh? - it looks a\n"
 "little suspicious, don't it, eh? - Hast not been a pirate, hast thou?\n"
 "- Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou? - Dost not think of\n"
 "murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?\"  I protested my\n"
 "innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of these half\n"
 "humorous inuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish\n"
 "Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather\n"
 "distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the\n"
 "Vineyard.  \"But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before\n"
 "I think of shipping ye.\"  \"Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I\n"
 "want to see the world.\"  \"Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye\n"
 "clapped eye on Captain Ahab?\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"Who is Captain Ahab, sir?\"  \"Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain\n"
 "Ahab is the Captain of this ship.\"  \"I am mistaken then. I thought I\n"
 "was speaking to the Captain himself.\"  \"Thou art speaking to Captain\n"
 "Peleg - that's who ye are speaking to, young man.  It belongs to me\n"
 "and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage, and\n"
 "supplied with all her needs, including crew. We are part owners and\n"
 "agents.  But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to know what\n"
 "whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it\n"
 "out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye on\n"
 "Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg.\"\n"
 "\"What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?\"  \"Lost by\n"
 "a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed up,\n"
 "crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat! -\n"
 "ah, ah!\"  I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little\n"
 "touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as\n"
 "calmly as I could, \"What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how\n"
 "could I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale,\n"
 "though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of\n"
 "the accident.\"  \"Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft,\n"
 "d'ye see; thou dost not talk shark a bit. Sure, ye've been to sea\n"
 "before now; sure of that?\"  \"Sir,\" said I, \"I thought I told you that\n"
 "I had been four voyages in the merchant - \" \"Hard down out of that!\n"
 "Mind what I said about the marchant service - don't aggravate me - I\n"
 "won't have it. But let us understand each other. I have given thee a\n"
 "hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel inclined for it?\"  \"I do,\n"
 "sir.\"  \"Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a\n"
 "live whale's throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!\"  \"I am,\n"
 "sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be got\n"
 "rid of, that is; which I don't take to be the fact.\"  \"Good again. Now\n"
 "then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out by experience\n"
 "what whaling is, but ye also want to\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " go in order to see the world? Was not that what ye said? I\n"
 "thought so. Well then, just step forward there, and take a peep over\n"
 "the weather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there.\"\n"
 "For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not\n"
 "knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But\n"
 "concentrating all his crow's feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg\n"
 "started me on the errand.  Going forward and glancing over the weather\n"
 "bow, I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the\n"
 "flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean. The\n"
 "prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not\n"
 "the slightest variety that I could see.  \"Well, what's the report?\"\n"
 "said Peleg when I came back; \"what did ye see?\"  \"Not much,\" I replied\n"
 "- \"nothing but water; considerable horizon though, and there's a\n"
 "squall coming up, I think.\"  \"Well, what dost thou think then of\n"
 "seeing the world? Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of\n"
 "it, eh? Can't ye see the world where you stand?\"  I was a little\n"
 "staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the Pequod was as\n"
 "good a ship as any - I thought the best - and all this I now repeated\n"
 "to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness to\n"
 "ship me.  \"And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,\" he\n"
 "added - \" come along with ye.\" And so saying, he led the way below\n"
 "deck into the cabin.  Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a\n"
 "most uncommon and surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain\n"
 "Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of\n"
 "the vessel; the other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports,\n"
 "being held by a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children,\n"
 "and chancery wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a\n"
 "foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket\n"
 "invest their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours\n"
 "in approved state stocks bringing in good interest.  Now, Bildad, like\n"
 "Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " was a Quaker, the island having been originally settled by\n"
 "that sect; and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an\n"
 "uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and\n"
 "anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For\n"
 "some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and\n"
 "whale-hunters. They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a\n"
 "vengeance.  So that there are instances among them of men, who, named\n"
 "with Scripture names - a singularly common fashion on the island - and\n"
 "in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of\n"
 "the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless\n"
 "adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these\n"
 "unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not\n"
 "unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when\n"
 "these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a\n"
 "globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness\n"
 "and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and\n"
 "beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think\n"
 "untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature's sweet or\n"
 "savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding\n"
 "breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental\n"
 "advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language - that man\n"
 "makes one in a whole nation's census - a mighty pageant creature,\n"
 "formed for noble tragedies.  Nor will it at all detract from him,\n"
 "dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he\n"
 "have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of\n"
 "his nature. For all men tragically great are made so through a certain\n"
 "morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is\n"
 "but disease. But, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with\n"
 "quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only\n"
 "results again from another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual\n"
 "circumstances.  Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do,\n"
 "retired whaleman. But unlike Captain Peleg - who cared not a rush for\n"
 "what are called serious things, and indeed deemed those selfsame\n"
 "serious things the veriest of all trifles - Captain Bildad\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " had not only been originally educated according to the\n"
 "strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean\n"
 "life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island creatures, round the\n"
 "Horn - all that had not moved this native born Quaker one single jot,\n"
 "had not so much as altered one angle of his vest. Still, for all this\n"
 "immutableness, was there some lack of common consistency about worthy\n"
 "Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear\n"
 "arms against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the\n"
 "Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet\n"
 "had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of\n"
 "leviathan gore.  How now in the contemplative evening of his days, the\n"
 "pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not\n"
 "know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he\n"
 "had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man's\n"
 "religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This\n"
 "world pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes\n"
 "of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied\n"
 "waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain,\n"
 "and finally a ship-owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded\n"
 "his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the\n"
 "goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet\n"
 "receiving of his well-earned income.  Now Bildad, I am sorry to say,\n"
 "had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks, and in his\n"
 "sea-going days, a bitter, hard task-master. They told me in Nantucket,\n"
 "though it certainly seems a curious story, that when he sailed the old\n"
 "Categut whaleman, his crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all\n"
 "carried ashore to the hospital, sore exhausted and worn out. For a\n"
 "pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was certainly rather\n"
 "hard-hearted to say the least. He never used to swear, though, at his\n"
 "men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel,\n"
 "unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a chief-mate, to\n"
 "have his drab-colored eye intently looking at you, made you feel\n"
 "completely nervous, till you could clutch something - a hammer or a\n"
 "marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other, never\n"
 "mind what.  Indolence and\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " idleness perished from before him. His own person was the\n"
 "exact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his long, gaunt\n"
 "body, he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having\n"
 "a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad- brimmed\n"
 "hat.  Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when\n"
 "I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the\n"
 "decks was small; and there, bolt- upright, sat old Bildad, who always\n"
 "sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His\n"
 "broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his\n"
 "drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he\n"
 "seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.  \"Bildad,\" cried\n"
 "Captain Peleg,\" at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been studying those\n"
 "Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain\n"
 "knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?\"  As if long habituated to such\n"
 "profane talk from his old shipmate, Bildad, without noticing his\n"
 "present irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing me, glanced again\n"
 "inquiringly towards Peleg.  \"He says he's our man, Bildad,\" said\n"
 "Peleg,\" he wants to ship.\"  \"Dost thee?\" said Bildad, in a hollow\n"
 "tone, and turning round to me.  \"I dost,\" said I unconsciously, he was\n"
 "so intense a Quaker.  \"What do ye think of him, Bildad?\" said Peleg.\n"
 "\"He'll do,\" said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at\n"
 "his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.  I thought him the queerest\n"
 "old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his friend and old\n"
 "shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said nothing, only looking\n"
 "round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the\n"
 "ship's articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at\n"
 "a little table. I began to think it was high time to settle with\n"
 "myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage. I\n"
 "was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages; but\n"
 "all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of the\n"
 "profits called lays, and that these lays were proportioned to the\n"
 "degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship's\n"
 "company.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own\n"
 "lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the\n"
 "sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt\n"
 "that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay -\n"
 "that is, the 275th part of the clear nett proceeds of the voyage,\n"
 "whatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was\n"
 "what they call a rather long lay, yet it was better than nothing; and\n"
 "if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I\n"
 "would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years' beef and board,\n"
 "for which I would not have to pay one stiver.  It might be thought\n"
 "that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune - and so it\n"
 "was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those that never take on\n"
 "about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world is ready to\n"
 "board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim sign of the\n"
 "Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay would be\n"
 "about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I been\n"
 "offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.  But\n"
 "one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about\n"
 "receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had\n"
 "heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony\n"
 "Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod,\n"
 "therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left\n"
 "nearly the whole management of the ship's affairs to these two. And I\n"
 "did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal\n"
 "to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board\n"
 "the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as\n"
 "if at his own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a\n"
 "pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise,\n"
 "considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings;\n"
 "Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his\n"
 "book,\" Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth - \"\n"
 "\"Well, Captain Bildad,\" interrupted Peleg,\" what d'ye say, what lay\n"
 "shall we give this young man?\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"Thou knowest best,\" was the sepulchral reply, \"the seven\n"
 "hundred and seventy-seventh wouldn't be too much, would it? - \"where\n"
 "moth and rust do corrupt, but lay - \"\" Lay, indeed, thought I, and\n"
 "such a lay! the seven hundred and seventy-seventh!  Well, old Bildad,\n"
 "you are determined that I, for one, shall not lay up many lays here\n"
 "below, where moth and rust do corrupt. It was an exceedingly long lay\n"
 "that, indeed; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at\n"
 "first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show\n"
 "that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number,\n"
 "yet, when you come to make a teenth of it, you will then see, I say,\n"
 "that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a\n"
 "good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons;\n"
 "and so I thought at the time.  \"Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,\" cried\n"
 "Peleg, \"Thou dost not want to swindle this young man! he must have\n"
 "more than that.\"  \"Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,\" again said\n"
 "Bildad, without lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling - \"for\n"
 "where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\"  \"I am going\n"
 "to put him down for the three hundredth,\" said Peleg, \"do ye hear\n"
 "that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.\"  Bildad laid down his\n"
 "book, and turning solemnly towards him said, \"Captain Peleg, thou hast\n"
 "a generous heart; but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the\n"
 "other owners of this ship - widows and orphans, many of them - and\n"
 "that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man, we may\n"
 "be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans. The seven\n"
 "hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.\"  \"Thou Bildad!\"\n"
 "roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin. \"Blast ye,\n"
 "Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these matters, I would\n"
 "afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to\n"
 "founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.\"  \"Captain\n"
 "Peleg,\" said Bildad steadily, \"thy conscience may be drawing ten\n"
 "inches of water, or ten fathoms, i can't tell; but as thou art still\n"
 "an impenitent man, captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience\n"
 "be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to\n"
 "the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural\n"
 "bearing, ye insult me. It's an all-fired outrage to tell any human\n"
 "creature that he's bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that\n"
 "again to me, and start my soul-bolts, but I'll - I'll - yes, I'll\n"
 "swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on.  Out of the cabin,\n"
 "ye canting, drab-colored son of a wooden gun - a straight wake with\n"
 "ye!\"  As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a\n"
 "marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.\n"
 "Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and\n"
 "responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all\n"
 "idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily\n"
 "commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad,\n"
 "who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the\n"
 "awakened wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on\n"
 "the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest\n"
 "intention of withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and\n"
 "his ways.  As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there\n"
 "seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though\n"
 "he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated. \"Whew!\" he\n"
 "whistled at last - \"the squall's gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad,\n"
 "thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My\n"
 "jack-knife here needs the grindstone. That's he; thank ye, Bildad. Now\n"
 "then, my young man, Ishmael's thy name, didn't ye say? Well then, down\n"
 "ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth lay.\"  \"Captain Peleg,\"\n"
 "said I, \"I have a friend with me who wants to ship too - shall I bring\n"
 "him down to-morrow?\"  \"To be sure,\" said Peleg. \"Fetch him along, and\n"
 "we'll look at him.\"  \"What lay does he want?\" groaned Bildad, glancing\n"
 "up from the book in which he had again been burying himself.  \"Oh!\n"
 "never thee mind about that, Bildad,\" said Peleg. \"Has he ever whaled\n"
 "it any?\" turning to me.  \"Killed more whales than I can count,\"\n"
 "Captain Peleg.  \"Well, bring him along then.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting\n"
 "but that I had done a good morning's work, and that the Pequod was the\n"
 "identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round\n"
 "the Cape.  But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me\n"
 "that the captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me;\n"
 "though, indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted\n"
 "out, and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself\n"
 "visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are\n"
 "so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief,\n"
 "that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of\n"
 "that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port,\n"
 "but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is\n"
 "always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing\n"
 "yourself into his hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg,\n"
 "inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.  \"And what dost thou\n"
 "want of Captain Ahab? It's all right enough; thou art shipped.\"  \"Yes,\n"
 "but I should like to see him.\"  \"But I don't think thou wilt be able\n"
 "to at present. I don't know exactly what's the matter with him; but he\n"
 "keeps close inside the house; a sort of sick, and yet he don't look\n"
 "so. In fact, he ain't sick; but no, he isn't well either. Any how,\n"
 "young man, he won't always see me, so I don't suppose he will\n"
 "thee. He's a queer man, Captain Ahab - so some think - but a good\n"
 "one. Oh, thou'lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear. he's a grand,\n"
 "ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn't speak much; but, when he\n"
 "does speak, then you may well listen.  Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab's\n"
 "above the common; Ahab's been in colleges, as well as 'mong the\n"
 "cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery\n"
 "lance in mightier stranger foes than whales. His lance! aye, the\n"
 "keenest and the surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain't Captain\n"
 "Bildad; no, and he ain't Captain Peleg; he's Ahab, boy; and Ahab of\n"
 "old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!\"  \"And a very vile one. When\n"
 "that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood?\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"Come hither to me - hither, hither,\" said Peleg, with a\n"
 "significance in his eye that almost startled me. \"Look ye, lad; never\n"
 "say that on board the Pequod.  Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did\n"
 "not name himself. 'Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed\n"
 "mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old\n"
 "squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove\n"
 "prophetic. And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the\n"
 "same. I wish to warn thee. It's a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I've\n"
 "sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is - a good man -\n"
 "not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good man -\n"
 "something like me - only there's a good deal more of him. Aye, aye, I\n"
 "know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the passage\n"
 "home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was the\n"
 "sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about, as\n"
 "any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg last\n"
 "voyage by that accursed whale, he's been a kind of moody - desperate\n"
 "moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass off. And once for\n"
 "all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it's better to sail\n"
 "with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one. So good-bye to thee\n"
 "- and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked\n"
 "name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife - not three voyages wedded - a\n"
 "sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that old man\n"
 "has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm in\n"
 "Ahab?  No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his\n"
 "humanities!\"  As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had\n"
 "been incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a\n"
 "certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him. And somehow, at\n"
 "the time, I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don't know\n"
 "what, unless it was the cruel loss of his leg. And yet I also felt a\n"
 "strange awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all\n"
 "describe, was not exactly awe; I do not know what it was. But I felt\n"
 "it; and it did not disincline me towards him; though I felt impatience\n"
 "at what seemed like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to\n"
 "me then.  However, my thoughts were at length carried in other\n"
 "directions, so that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " As Queequeg's Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to\n"
 "continue all day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards\n"
 "night-fall; for I cherish the greatest respect towards everybody's\n"
 "religious obligations, never mind how comical, and could not find it\n"
 "in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a\n"
 "toad-stool; or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth,\n"
 "who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets,\n"
 "bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on\n"
 "account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his\n"
 "name.  I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in\n"
 "these things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other\n"
 "mortals, pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on\n"
 "these subjects. There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the\n"
 "most absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan; - but what of that?\n"
 "Queequeg thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be\n"
 "content; and there let him rest. All our arguing with him would not\n"
 "avail; let him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all -\n"
 "Presbyterians and Pagans alike - for we are all somehow dreadfully\n"
 "cracked about the head, and sadly need mending.  Towards evening, when\n"
 "I felt assured that all his performances and rituals must be over, I\n"
 "went up to his room and knocked at the door; but no answer. I tried to\n"
 "open it, but it was fastened inside. \"Queequeg,\" said I softly through\n"
 "the key-hole: - all silent. \"I say, Queequeg! why don't you speak?\n"
 "It's I - Ishmael.\" But all remained still as before. I began to grow\n"
 "alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant time; I thought he might have\n"
 "had an apoplectic fit. I looked through the key-hole; but the door\n"
 "opening into an odd corner of the room, the key-hole prospect was but\n"
 "a crooked and sinister one. I could only see part of the foot-board of\n"
 "the bed and a line of\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the wall, but nothing more. I was surprised to behold resting\n"
 "against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg's harpoon, which the\n"
 "landlady the evening previous had taken from him, before our mounting\n"
 "to the chamber. That's strange, thought I; but at any rate, since the\n"
 "harpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without it,\n"
 "therefore he must be inside here, and no possible mistake.  \"Queequeg!\n"
 "- Queequeg!\" - all still. Something must have happened. Apoplexy! I\n"
 "tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted. Running down\n"
 "stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person i met - the\n"
 "chambermaid. \"La!  La!\" she cried, \"I thought something must be the\n"
 "matter. I went to make the bed after breakfast, and the door was\n"
 "locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and it's been just so silent ever\n"
 "since. But I thought, may be, you had both gone off and locked your\n"
 "baggage in for safe keeping. La! La, ma'am! - Mistress! murder! Mrs.\n"
 "Hussey! apoplexy!\" - and with these cries, she ran towards the\n"
 "kitchen, I following.  Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot\n"
 "in one hand and a vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away\n"
 "from the occupation of attending to the castors, and scolding her\n"
 "little black boy meantime.  \"Wood- house!\" cried I, \"which way to it?\n"
 "Run for God's sake, and fetch something to pry open the door - the\n"
 "axe! - the axe! he's had a stroke; depend upon it!\" - and so saying I\n"
 "was unmethodically rushing up stairs again empty-handed, when\n"
 "Mrs. Hussey interposed the mustard-pot and vinegar-cruet, and the\n"
 "entire castor of her countenance.  \"What's the matter with you, young\n"
 "man?\"  \"Get the axe! For God's sake, run for the doctor, some one,\n"
 "while I pry it open!\"  \"Look here,\" said the landlady, quickly putting\n"
 "down the vinegar-cruet, so as to have one hand free; \"look here; are\n"
 "you talking about prying open any of my doors?\" - and with that she\n"
 "seized my arm. \"What's the matter with you? What's the matter with\n"
 "you, shipmate?\"  In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave\n"
 "her to understand the whole case. Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-\n"
 "cruet\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " to one side of her nose, she ruminated for an instant; then\n"
 "exclaimed - \"No! I haven't seen it since I put it there.\" Running to a\n"
 "little closet under the landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and\n"
 "returning, told me that Queequeg's harpoon was missing. \"He's killed\n"
 "himself,\" she cried. \"It's unfort'nate stiggs done over again - there\n"
 "goes another counterpane - god pity his poor mother! - it will be the\n"
 "ruin of my house. Has the poor lad a sister? Where's that girl? -\n"
 "there, Betty, go to Snarles the Painter, and tell him to paint me a\n"
 "sign, with - \"no suicides permitted here, and no smoking in the\n"
 "parlor;\" - might as well kill both birds at once. Kill? The Lord be\n"
 "merciful to his ghost! What's that noise there? You, young man, avast\n"
 "there!\"  And running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying\n"
 "to force open the door.  \"I won't allow it; I won't have my premises\n"
 "spoiled. Go for the locksmith, there's one about a mile from here. But\n"
 "avast!\" putting her hand in her side-pocket, \"here's a key that'll\n"
 "fit, I guess; let's see.\" And with that, she turned it in the lock;\n"
 "but, alas! Queequeg's supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.\n"
 "\"Have to burst it open,\" said I, and was running down the entry a\n"
 "little, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing\n"
 "I should not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and with a\n"
 "sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark.  With a\n"
 "prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming against the\n"
 "wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good heavens! there\n"
 "sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected; right in the middle\n"
 "of the room; squatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on top of his\n"
 "head. He looked neither one way nor the other way, but sat like a\n"
 "carved image with scarce a sign of active life.  \"Queequeg,\" said I,\n"
 "going up to him, \"Queequeg, what's the matter with you?\"  \"He hain't\n"
 "been a sittin' so all day, has he?\" said the landlady.  But all we\n"
 "said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt like pushing\n"
 "him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost intolerable,\n"
 "it seemed so painfully and unnaturally\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " constrained; especially, as in all probability he had been\n"
 "sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours, going too without his\n"
 "regular meals.  \"Mrs. Hussey,\" said I, \"he's alive at all events; so\n"
 "leave us, if you please, and I will see to this strange affair\n"
 "myself.\"  Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail\n"
 "upon Queequeg to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he\n"
 "could do - for all my polite arts and blandishments - he would not\n"
 "move a peg, nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my\n"
 "presence in any the slightest way.  I wonder, thought I, if this can\n"
 "possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do they fast on their hams that way\n"
 "in his native island. It must be so; yes, it's part of his creed, I\n"
 "suppose; well, then, let him rest; he'll get up sooner or later, no\n"
 "doubt. It can't last for ever, thank God, and his Ramadan only comes\n"
 "once a year; and I don't believe it's very punctual then.  I went down\n"
 "to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long stories of\n"
 "some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage, as they\n"
 "called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig,\n"
 "confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only); after\n"
 "listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o'clock, I went\n"
 "up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must\n"
 "certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination. But no; there he\n"
 "was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began to\n"
 "grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be\n"
 "sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room,\n"
 "holding a piece of wood on his head.  \"For heaven's sake, Queequeg,\n"
 "get up and shake yourself; get up and have some supper. You'll starve;\n"
 "you'll kill yourself, Queequeg.\" But not a word did he reply.\n"
 "Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;\n"
 "and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous\n"
 "to turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him,\n"
 "as it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his\n"
 "ordinary round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not\n"
 "get into the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere\n"
 "thought of Queequeg -\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " not four feet off - sitting there in that uneasy position,\n"
 "stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really wretched. Think\n"
 "of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on\n"
 "his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!  But somehow I dropped\n"
 "off at last, and knew nothing more till break of day; when, looking\n"
 "over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he had been screwed\n"
 "down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the\n"
 "window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but with a cheerful\n"
 "look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his forehead again\n"
 "against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.  Now, as I before hinted,\n"
 "I have no objection to any person's religion, be it what it may, so\n"
 "long as that person does not kill or insult any other person, because\n"
 "that other person don't believe it also. But when a man's religion\n"
 "becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment to him; and, in\n"
 "fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in; then\n"
 "I think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point\n"
 "with him.  And just so I now did with Queequeg. \"Queequeg,\" said I,\n"
 "\"get into bed now, and lie and listen to me.\" I then went on,\n"
 "beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religions, and\n"
 "coming down to the various religions of the present time, during which\n"
 "time I labored to show Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and\n"
 "prolonged ham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense;\n"
 "bad for the health; useless for the soul; opposed, in short, to the\n"
 "obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense. I told him, too, that he\n"
 "being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage,\n"
 "it pained me, very badly pained me, to see him now so deplorably\n"
 "foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his. Besides, argued I,\n"
 "fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves in; and all\n"
 "thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved. This is the\n"
 "reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions\n"
 "about their hereafters. In one word, Queequeg, said I, rather\n"
 "digressively; hell is an idea first born on an undigested\n"
 "apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through the hereditary\n"
 "dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled\n"
 "with dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could\n"
 "take it in. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was after\n"
 "a great feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great\n"
 "battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o'clock\n"
 "in the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.  \"No\n"
 "more, Queequeg,\" said I, shuddering; \"that will do;\" for I knew the\n"
 "inferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who\n"
 "had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom,\n"
 "when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain\n"
 "in the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were\n"
 "placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau,\n"
 "with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths,\n"
 "were sent round with the victor's compliments to all his friends, just\n"
 "as though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.  After all, I\n"
 "do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon\n"
 "Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow seemed dull of\n"
 "hearing on that important subject, unless considered from his own\n"
 "point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more than one\n"
 "third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and, finally,\n"
 "he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion\n"
 "than I did. He looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and\n"
 "compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible\n"
 "young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety.  At\n"
 "last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty\n"
 "breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not\n"
 "make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the\n"
 "Pequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship,\n"
 "Queequeg carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly\n"
 "hailed us from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a\n"
 "cannibal, and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board\n"
 "that craft, unless they previously produced their papers.  \"What do\n"
 "you mean by that, Captain Peleg?\" said I, now jumping on the bulwarks,\n"
 "and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.  \"I mean,\" he replied,\n"
 "\"he must show his papers.\"  \"Yea,\" said Captain Bildad in his hollow\n"
 "voice, sticking his head from behind Peleg's, out of the wigwam. \"He\n"
 "must show that he's converted. Son of darkness,\" he added, turning to\n"
 "Queequeg, \"art thou at present in communion with any christian\n"
 "church?\"  \"Why,\" said I, \"he's a member of the First Congregational\n"
 "Church.\" Here be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in\n"
 "Nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches.\n"
 "\"First Congregational Church,\" cried Bildad, \"what! that worships in\n"
 "Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman's meeting-house?\" and so saying, taking out\n"
 "his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana\n"
 "handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the\n"
 "wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look\n"
 "at Queequeg.  \"How long hath he been a member?\" he then said, turning\n"
 "to me; \"not very long, I rather guess, young man.\"  \"No,\" said Peleg,\n"
 "\"and he hasn't been baptized right either, or it would have washed\n"
 "some of that devil's blue off his face.\"  \"Do tell, now,\" cried\n"
 "Bildad, \"is this Philistine a regular member of Deacon Deuteronomy's\n"
 "meeting? I never saw him going there, and I pass it every Lord's day.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"I don't know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his\n"
 "meeeting,\" said I, \"all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member\n"
 "of the First Congregational Church.  He is a deacon himself, Queequeg\n"
 "is.\"  \"Young man,\" said Bildad sternly, \"thou art skylarking with me -\n"
 "explain thyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean?\n"
 "answer me.\"  Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. \"I mean, sir,\n"
 "the same ancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg\n"
 "there, and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother's son and\n"
 "soul of us belong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of\n"
 "this whole worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us\n"
 "cherish some queer crotchets noways touching the grand belief; in that\n"
 "we all join hands.\"  Splice, thou mean'st splice hands,\" cried Peleg,\n"
 "drawing nearer. \"Young man, you'd better ship for a missionary,\n"
 "instead of a fore-mast hand; I never heard a better sermon. Deacon\n"
 "Deuteronomy - why Father Mapple himself couldn't beat it, and he's\n"
 "reckoned something. Come aboard, come aboard; never mind about the\n"
 "papers. I say, tell Quohog there - what's that you call him? tell\n"
 "Quohog to step along. By the great anchor, what a harpoon he's got\n"
 "there! looks like good stuff that; and he handles it about right. I\n"
 "say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did you ever stand in the head\n"
 "of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a fish?\"  Without saying a word,\n"
 "Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon the bulwarks, from\n"
 "thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats hanging to the side;\n"
 "and then bracing his left knee, and poising his harpoon, cried out in\n"
 "some such way as this: - \"Cap'ain, you see him small drop tar on water\n"
 "dere? You see him? well, spose him one whale eye, well, den!\" and\n"
 "taking sharp aim at it, he darted the iron right over old Bildad's\n"
 "broad brim, clean across the ship's decks, and struck the glistening\n"
 "tar spot out of sight.  \"Now,\" said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the\n"
 "line, \"spos-ee him whale-e eye; why, dad whale dead.\"  \"Quick,\n"
 "Bildad,\" said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " close vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards\n"
 "the cabin gangway.  \"Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship's\n"
 "papers. We must have Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our\n"
 "boats. Look ye, Quohog, we'll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that's\n"
 "more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.\"  So down\n"
 "we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon enrolled\n"
 "among the same ship's company to which I myself belonged.  When all\n"
 "preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for\n"
 "signing, he turned to me and said, \"I guess Quohog there don't know\n"
 "how to write, does he? I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy\n"
 "name or make thy mark?\"  But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice\n"
 "or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies, looked no ways\n"
 "abashed; but taking the offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the\n"
 "proper place, an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was\n"
 "tattooed upon his arm; so that through Captain Peleg's obstinate\n"
 "mistake touching his appellative, it stood something like this: -\n"
 "Quohog his mark illustration of the infinity sign Meanwhile Captain\n"
 "Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg, and at last\n"
 "rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broad-skirted\n"
 "drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one entitled\n"
 "\"The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose,\" placed it in queequeg's\n"
 "hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his, looked\n"
 "earnestly into his eyes, and said, \"Son of darkness, I must do my duty\n"
 "by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned for the\n"
 "souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways, which\n"
 "I sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial bondsman.\n"
 "Spurn the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the wrath to\n"
 "come; mind thine eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer clear of the\n"
 "fiery pit!\"  Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad's\n"
 "language, heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.\n"
 "\"Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our harpooneer,\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " cried Peleg. \"Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers - it\n"
 "takes the shark out of 'em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint\n"
 "pretty sharkish. There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest\n"
 "boat-header out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the\n"
 "meeting, and never came to good. He got so frightened about his plaguy\n"
 "soul, that he shrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear of\n"
 "after-claps in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones.\"  Peleg!\n"
 "Peleg!\" said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, \"thou thyself, as I\n"
 "myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, Peleg, what it\n"
 "is to have the fear of death; how, then, can'st thou prate in this\n"
 "ungodly guise. Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this\n"
 "same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on\n"
 "Japan, that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab, did'st\n"
 "thou not think of Death and the Judgment then?\"  \"Hear him, hear him\n"
 "now,\" cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and thrusting his hands\n"
 "far down into his pockets, - \"hear him, all of ye. Think of that! When\n"
 "every moment we thought the ship would sink! Death and the judgment\n"
 "then? What?  With all three masts making such an everlasting\n"
 "thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over us, fore and\n"
 "aft. Think of Death and the Judgment then?  No! no time to think about\n"
 "Death then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of; and how\n"
 "to save all hands - how to rig jury-masts - how to get into the\n"
 "nearest port; that was what I was thinking of.\"  Bildad said no more,\n"
 "but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where we followed\n"
 "him. There he stood, very quietly overlooking some sail-makers who\n"
 "were mending a top-sail in the waist. Now and then he stooped to pick\n"
 "up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which otherwise might have\n"
 "been wasted.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?\"  Queequeg and I had\n"
 "just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from the water, for the\n"
 "moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when the above words were\n"
 "put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us, levelled his massive\n"
 "forefinger at the vessel in question. He was but shabbily apparelled\n"
 "in faded jacket and patched trowsers; a rag of a black handkerchief\n"
 "investing his neck. A confluent small-pox had in all directions flowed\n"
 "over his face, and left it like the complicated ribbed bed of a\n"
 "torrent, when the rushing waters have been dried up.  \"Have ye shipped\n"
 "in her?\" he repeated.  \"You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose,\" said I,\n"
 "trying to gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him.\n"
 "\"Aye, the Pequod - that ship there,\" he said, drawing back his whole\n"
 "arm, and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the fixed\n"
 "bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.  \"Yes,\" said\n"
 "I, \"we have just signed the articles.\"  \"Anything down there about\n"
 "your souls?\"  \"About what?\"  \"Oh, perhaps you hav'n't got any,\" he\n"
 "said quickly. \"No matter though, I know many chaps that hav'n't got\n"
 "any, - good luck to 'em; and they are all the better off for it. A\n"
 "soul's a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon.\"  \"What are you jabbering\n"
 "about, shipmate?\" said I.  \"He's got enough, though, to make up for\n"
 "all deficiencies of that sort in other chaps,\" abruptly said the\n"
 "stranger, placing a nervous emphasis upon the word he.\n"
 "\n"
 "\"Queequeg,\" said I, \"let's go; this fellow has broken loose from\n"
 "somewhere; he's talking about something and somebody we don't know.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"Stop!\" cried the stranger. \"Ye said true - ye hav'n't seen\n"
 "Old Thunder yet, have ye?\"  \"Who's Old Thunder?\" said I, again riveted\n"
 "with the insane earnestness of his manner.  \"Captain Ahab.\"  \"What!\n"
 "the captain of our ship, the Pequod?\"  \"Aye, among some of us old\n"
 "sailor chaps, he goes by that name. Ye hav'n't seen him yet, have ye?\"\n"
 "\"No, we hav'n't. He's sick they say, but is getting better, and will\n"
 "be all right again before long.\"  \"All right again before long!\"\n"
 "laughed the stranger, with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh. \"Look\n"
 "ye; when captain Ahab is all right, then this left arm of mine will be\n"
 "all right; not before.\"  \"What do you know about him?\"  \"What did they\n"
 "tell you about him? Say that!\"  \"They didn't tell much of anything\n"
 "about him; only I've heard that he's a good whale-hunter, and a good\n"
 "captain to his crew.\"  \"That's true, that's true - yes, both true\n"
 "enough. But you must jump when he gives an order. Step and growl;\n"
 "growl and go - that's the word with Captain Ahab. But nothing about\n"
 "that thing that happened to him off Cape Horn, long ago, when he lay\n"
 "like dead for three days and nights; nothing about that deadly\n"
 "skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar in Santa? - heard nothing\n"
 "about that, eh? Nothing about the silver calabash he spat into? And\n"
 "nothing about his losing his leg last voyage, according to the\n"
 "prophecy. Didn't ye hear a word about them matters and something more,\n"
 "eh? No, I don't think ye did; how could ye? Who knows it? Not all\n"
 "Nantucket, I guess. But hows'ever, mayhap, ye've heard tell about the\n"
 "leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of that, I dare say.  Oh\n"
 "yes, that every one knows a'most - I mean they know he's only one leg;\n"
 "and that a parmacetti took the other off.\"  \"My friend,\" said I, \"what\n"
 "all this gibberish of yours is about, I don't know, and I don't much\n"
 "care; for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the\n"
 "head. But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab, of that ship there, the\n"
 "Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know all about the loss of his\n"
 "leg.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"All about it, eh - sure you do? - all?\"  \"Pretty sure.\"  With\n"
 "finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like\n"
 "stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a\n"
 "little, turned and said: - \"Ye've shipped, have ye? Names down on the\n"
 "papers? Well, well, what's signed, is signed; and what's to be, will\n"
 "be; and then again, perhaps it wont be, after all. Any how, it's all\n"
 "fixed and arranged a'ready; and some sailors or other must go with\n"
 "him, I suppose; as well these as any other men, God pity 'em!  Morning\n"
 "to ye, shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye; I'm sorry I\n"
 "stopped ye.\"  \"Look here, friend,\" said I, \"if you have anything\n"
 "important to tell us, out with it; but if you are only trying to\n"
 "bamboozle us, you are mistaken in your game; that's all I have to\n"
 "say.\"  \"And it's said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up\n"
 "that way; you are just the man for him - the likes of ye. Morning to\n"
 "ye, shipmates, morning! Oh, when ye get there, tell 'em I've concluded\n"
 "not to make one of 'em.\"  \"Ah, my dear fellow, you can't fool us that\n"
 "way - you can't fool us. It is the easiest thing in the world for a\n"
 "man to look as if he had a great secret in him.\"  \"Morning to ye,\n"
 "shipmates, morning.\"  \"Morning it is,\" said I. \"Come along, Queequeg,\n"
 "let's leave this crazy man. But stop, tell me your name, will you?\"\n"
 "\"Elijah.\"  Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting,\n"
 "after each other's fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed\n"
 "that he was nothing but a humbug, trying to be a bugbear. But we had\n"
 "not gone perhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a\n"
 "corner, and looking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah\n"
 "following us, though at a distance. Somehow, the sight of him struck\n"
 "me so, that I said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed\n"
 "on with my comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the\n"
 "same corner that we did. He did; and then it seemed to me that he was\n"
 "dogging us, but with what intent I could not for the life of me\n"
 "imagine. This circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous, half-hinting,\n"
 "half-revealing, shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " all kinds of vague wonderments and half-apprehensions, and all\n"
 "connected with the Pequod; and Captain Ahab; and the leg he had lost;\n"
 "and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver calabash; and what Captain Peleg\n"
 "had said of him, when I left the ship the day previous; and the\n"
 "prediction of the squaw Tistig; and the voyage we had bound ourselves\n"
 "to sail; and a hundred other shadowy things.  I was resolved to\n"
 "satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really dogging us or\n"
 "not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg, and on that\n"
 "side of it retraced our steps. But Elijah passed on, without seeming\n"
 "to notice us.  This relieved me; and once more, and finally as it\n"
 "seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a humbug.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " A day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the\n"
 "Pequod. Not only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were\n"
 "coming on board, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short,\n"
 "everything betokened that the ship's preparations were hurrying to a\n"
 "close. Captain Peleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his\n"
 "wigwam keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the\n"
 "purchasing and providing at the stores; and the men employed in the\n"
 "hold and on the rigging were working till long after night-fall.  On\n"
 "the day following Queequeg's signing the articles, word was given at\n"
 "all the inns where the ship's company were stopping, that their chests\n"
 "must be on board before night, for there was no telling how soon the\n"
 "vessel might be sailing. So Queequeg and I got down our traps,\n"
 "resolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last. But it seems they\n"
 "always give very long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail\n"
 "for several days. But no wonder; there was a good deal to be done, and\n"
 "there\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " is no telling how many things to be thought of, before the\n"
 "Pequod was fully equipped.  Every one knows what a multitude of things\n"
 "- beds, sauce-pans, knives and forks, shovels and tongs, napkins,\n"
 "nut-crackers, and what not, are indispensable to the business of\n"
 "housekeeping. Just so with whaling, which necessitates a three-years'\n"
 "housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far from all grocers, costermongers,\n"
 "doctors, bakers, and bankers. And though this also holds true of\n"
 "merchant vessels, yet not by any means to the same extent as with\n"
 "whalemen. For besides the great length of the whaling voyage, the\n"
 "numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery, and the\n"
 "impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually\n"
 "frequented, it must be remembered, that of all ships, whaling vessels\n"
 "are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds, and especially to the\n"
 "destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of the\n"
 "voyage most depends. Hence, the spare boats, spare spars, and spare\n"
 "lines and harpoons, and spare everythings, almost, but a spare captain\n"
 "and duplicate ship.\n"
 "\n"
 "At the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of\n"
 "the Pequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread,\n"
 "water, fuel, and iron hoops and staves. But, as before hinted, for\n"
 "some time there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of\n"
 "divers odds and ends of things, both large and small.  Chief among\n"
 "those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain Bildad's sister,\n"
 "a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit, but\n"
 "withal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if she could help\n"
 "it, nothing should be found wanting in the Pequod, after once fairly\n"
 "getting to sea. At one time she would come on board with a jar of\n"
 "pickles for the steward's pantry; another time with a bunch of quills\n"
 "for the chief mate's desk, where he kept his log; a third time with a\n"
 "roll of flannel for the small of some one's rheumatic back. Never did\n"
 "any woman better deserve her name, which was Charity - Aunt Charity,\n"
 "as everybody called her. And like a sister of charity did this\n"
 "charitable Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither, ready to turn\n"
 "her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety, comfort,\n"
 "and consolation to all on board\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " a ship in which her beloved brother Bildad was concerned, and\n"
 "in which she herself owned a score or two of well-saved dollars.  But\n"
 "it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on\n"
 "board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and\n"
 "a still longer whaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor\n"
 "Captain Peleg at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried about with\n"
 "him a long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival,\n"
 "down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper. Every once\n"
 "and a while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at\n"
 "the men down the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the\n"
 "mast-head, and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.  During\n"
 "these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the craft, and\n"
 "as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and when he was\n"
 "going to come on board his ship. To these questions they would answer,\n"
 "that he was getting better and better, and was expected aboard every\n"
 "day; meantime, the two Captains, Peleg and Bildad, could attend to\n"
 "everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I had been\n"
 "downright honest with myself, I would have seen very plainly in my\n"
 "heart that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a\n"
 "voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the\n"
 "absolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open\n"
 "sea. But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if\n"
 "he be already involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover\n"
 "up his suspicions even from himself. And much this way it was with\n"
 "me. I said nothing, and tried to think nothing.  At last it was given\n"
 "out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail.  So next\n"
 "morning, Queequeg and I took a very early start.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " It was nearly six o'clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn,\n"
 "when we drew nigh the wharf.  \"There are some sailors running ahead\n"
 "there, if I see right,\" said I to Queequeg, \"it can't be shadows;\n"
 "she's off by sunrise, I guess; come on!\"  \"Avast!\" cried a voice,\n"
 "whose owner at the same time coming close behind us, laid a hand upon\n"
 "both our shoulders, and then insinuating himself between us, stood\n"
 "stooping forward a little, in the uncertain twilight, strangely\n"
 "peering from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah.  \"Going aboard? Hands off,\n"
 "will you,\" said I.  \"Lookee here,\" said Queequeg, shaking himself,\" go\n"
 "'way!\"  \"Aint going aboard, then?\"  \"Yes, we are,\" said I, \"but what\n"
 "business is that of yours? Do you know, Mr.  Elijah, that I consider\n"
 "you a little impertinent?\"  \"No, no, no; I wasn't aware of that,\" said\n"
 "Elijah, slowly and wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the\n"
 "most unaccountable glances.  \"Elijah,\" said I, \"you will oblige my\n"
 "friend and me by withdrawing. We are going to the Indian and Pacific\n"
 "Oceans, and would prefer not to be detained.\"  \"Ye be, be ye? Coming\n"
 "back afore breakfast?\"  \"He's cracked, Queequeg,\" said I, \"come on.\"\n"
 "\"Holloa!\" cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a\n"
 "few paces.  \"Never mind him,\" said I, \"Queequeg, come on.\"  But he\n"
 "stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder,\n"
 "said - \"Did ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a\n"
 "while ago?\"  Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered,\n"
 "saying,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"Yes, I thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim\n"
 "to be sure.\"  \"Very dim, very dim,\" said Elijah. \"Morning to ye.\"\n"
 "Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and\n"
 "touching my shoulder again, said, \"See if you can find 'em now, will\n"
 "ye?\"  \"Find who?\"  \"Morning to ye! morning to ye!\" he rejoined, again\n"
 "moving off. \"Oh! I was going to warn ye against - but never mind,\n"
 "never mind - it's all one, all in the family too; - sharp frost this\n"
 "morning, ain't it? Good bye to ye. Shan't see ye again very soon, I\n"
 "guess; unless it's before the Grand Jury.\" And with these cracked\n"
 "words he finally departed, leaving me, for the moment, in no small\n"
 "wonderment at his frantic impudence.  At last, stepping on board the\n"
 "Pequod, we found everything in profound quiet, not a soul moving. The\n"
 "cabin entrance was locked within; the hatches were all on, and\n"
 "lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward to the forecastle, we\n"
 "found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a light, we went down, and\n"
 "found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a tattered pea-jacket. He\n"
 "was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his face downwards and\n"
 "inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber slept upon him.\n"
 "\"Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?\" said I,\n"
 "looking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the\n"
 "wharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I\n"
 "would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that\n"
 "matter, were it not for Elijah's otherwise inexplicable question. But\n"
 "I beat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted\n"
 "to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him\n"
 "to establish himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper's\n"
 "rear, as though feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more\n"
 "ado, sat quietly down there.  \"Gracious! Queequeg, don't sit there,\"\n"
 "said I.  \"Oh! perry dood seat,\" said Queequeg, \"my country way; won't\n"
 "hurt him face.\"  \"Face!\" said I, \"call that his face? very benevolent\n"
 "countenance\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " then; but how hard he breathes, he's heaving himself; get off,\n"
 "Queequeg, you are heavy, it's grinding the face of the poor. Get off,\n"
 "Queequeg! Look, he'll twitch you off soon. I wonder he don't wake.\"\n"
 "Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and\n"
 "lighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing\n"
 "over the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning\n"
 "him in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his\n"
 "land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the\n"
 "king, chiefs, and great people generally, were in the custom of\n"
 "fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a\n"
 "house comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten\n"
 "lazy fellows, and lay them round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it\n"
 "was very convenient on an excursion; much better than those\n"
 "garden-chairs which are convertible into walking-sticks; upon\n"
 "occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and desiring him to make a\n"
 "settee of himself under a spreading tree, perhaps in some damp marshy\n"
 "place.  While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the\n"
 "tomahawk from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the\n"
 "sleeper's head.  \"What's that for, Queequeg?\"  \"Perry easy, kill-e;\n"
 "oh! perry easy!\"  He was going on with some wild reminiscences about\n"
 "his tomahawk-pipe, which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained\n"
 "his foes and soothed his soul, when we were directly attracted to the\n"
 "sleeping rigger. The strong vapor now completely filling the\n"
 "contracted hole, it began to tell upon him. He breathed with a sort of\n"
 "muffledness; then seemed troubled in the nose; then revolved over once\n"
 "or twice; then sat up and rubbed his eyes.  \"Holloa!\" he breathed at\n"
 "last, \"who be ye smokers?\"  \"Shipped men,\" answered I, \"when does she\n"
 "sail?\"  \"Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The\n"
 "Captain came aboard last night.\"  \"What Captain? - Ahab?\"  \"Who but\n"
 "him indeed?\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " I was going to ask him some further questions concerning\n"
 "Ahab, when we heard a noise on deck.  \"Holloa! Starbuck's astir,\" said\n"
 "the rigger. \"He's a lively chief mate, that; good man, and a pious;\n"
 "but all alive now, I must turn to.\" And so saying he went on deck, and\n"
 "we followed.\"  It was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board\n"
 "in twos and threes; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were\n"
 "actively engaged; and several of the shore people were busy in\n"
 "bringing various last things on board. Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained\n"
 "invisibly enshrined within his cabin.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " At length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the\n"
 "ship's riggers, and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the\n"
 "wharf, and after the ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a\n"
 "whaleboat, with her last gift - a night-cap for Stubb, the second\n"
 "mate, her brother-in-law, and a spare bible for the steward - after\n"
 "all this, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin,\n"
 "and turning to the chief mate, Peleg said: \"Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you\n"
 "sure everything is right? Captain Ahab is all ready - just spoke to\n"
 "him - nothing more to be got from shore, eh? Well, call all hands,\n"
 "then. Muster 'em aft here - blast 'em!\"  \"No need of profane words,\n"
 "however great the hurry, Peleg,\" said Bildad, \"but away with thee,\n"
 "friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.\"  How now! Here upon the very\n"
 "point of starting for the voyage, Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad\n"
 "were going it with a high hand on the quarter-deck, just as if they\n"
 "were to be joint- commanders at sea, as well as to all appearances in\n"
 "port.  And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign of him was yet to be seen;\n"
 "Only, they said he was in the cabin. But then, the idea was,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the\n"
 "ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed, as that\n"
 "was not at all his proper business, but the pilot's; and as he was not\n"
 "yet completely recovered - so they said - therefore, Captain Ahab\n"
 "stayed below. And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the\n"
 "merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a\n"
 "considerable time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the\n"
 "cabin table, having a farewell merrymaking with their shore friends,\n"
 "before they quit the ship for good with the pilot.  But there was not\n"
 "much chance to think over the matter, for Captain Peleg was now all\n"
 "alive. He seemed to do most of the talking and commanding, and not\n"
 "Bildad.  \"Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,\" he cried, as the sailors\n"
 "lingered at the main-mast. \"Mr. Starbuck, drive 'em aft.\"  \"Strike the\n"
 "tent there! - was the next order. As I hinted before, this whalebone\n"
 "marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board the Pequod, for\n"
 "thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known to be the\n"
 "next thing to heaving up the anchor.  \"Man the capstan! Blood and\n"
 "thunder! - jump!\" - was the next command, and the crew sprang for the\n"
 "handspikes.  Now, in getting under weigh, the station generally\n"
 "occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship. And here\n"
 "Bildad, who, with Peleg, be it known, in addition to his other\n"
 "offices, was one of the licensed pilots of the port - he being\n"
 "suspected to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the\n"
 "Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was concerned in, for he never\n"
 "piloted any other craft - Bildad, I say, might now be seen actively\n"
 "engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor, and at\n"
 "intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody, to cheer the\n"
 "hands at the windlass, who roared forth some sort of a chorus about\n"
 "the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good will.  Nevertheless, not\n"
 "three days previous, Bildad had told them that no profane songs would\n"
 "be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in getting under weigh;\n"
 "and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice copy of Watts in\n"
 "each seaman's berth.  Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship,\n"
 "Captain Peleg\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner. I\n"
 "almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got\n"
 "up; involuntarily I paused on my handspike, and told Queequeg to do\n"
 "the same, thinking of the perils we both ran, in starting on the\n"
 "voyage with such a devil for a pilot. I was comforting myself,\n"
 "however, with the thought that in pious Bildad might be found some\n"
 "salvation, spite of his seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay; when I\n"
 "felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear, and turning round, was horrified\n"
 "at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg\n"
 "from my immediate vicinity.  That was my first kick.  \"Is that the way\n"
 "they heave in the marchant service?\" he roared. \"Spring, thou\n"
 "sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! why don't ye spring, i\n"
 "say, all of ye - spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red\n"
 "whiskers; spring there, Scotchcap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I\n"
 "say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!\" And so saying, he moved\n"
 "along the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while\n"
 "imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody.  Thinks I,\n"
 "Captain Peleg must have been drinking something to- day.  At last the\n"
 "anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It was a short,\n"
 "cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged into night, we\n"
 "found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose freezing\n"
 "spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor. The long rows of teeth on\n"
 "the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like the white ivory\n"
 "tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from the\n"
 "bows.  Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and\n"
 "anon, as the old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the\n"
 "shivering frost all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage\n"
 "rang, his steady notes were heard, - \"Sweet fields beyond the swelling\n"
 "flood, Stand dressed in living green.  So to the Jews old Canaan\n"
 "stood, While Jordan rolled between.\"  Never did those sweet words\n"
 "sound more sweetly to me than then. They were full of hope and\n"
 "fruition. Spite of this frigid\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " winter night in the boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet\n"
 "and wetter jacket, there was yet, it then seemed to me, many a\n"
 "pleasant haven in store; and meads and glades so eternally vernal,\n"
 "that the grass shot up by the spring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at\n"
 "midsummer.  At last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were\n"
 "needed no longer. The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began\n"
 "ranging alongside.  It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and\n"
 "Bildad were affected at this juncture, especially Captain Bildad. For\n"
 "loath to depart, yet; very loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on\n"
 "so long and perilous a voyage - beyond both stormy Capes; a ship in\n"
 "which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested; a ship,\n"
 "in which an old shipmate sailed as captain; a man almost as old as he,\n"
 "once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw;\n"
 "loath to say good-bye to a thing so every way brimful of every\n"
 "interest to him, - poor old Bildad lingered long; paced the deck with\n"
 "anxious strides\" ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell\n"
 "word there; again came on deck, and looked to windward; looked towards\n"
 "the wide and endless waters, only bounded by the far-off unseen\n"
 "Eastern Continents; looked towards the land, looked aloft; looked\n"
 "right and left; looked everywhere and nowhere; and at last,\n"
 "mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin, convulsively grasped stout\n"
 "Peleg by the hand, and holding up a lantern, for a moment stood gazing\n"
 "heroically in his face, as much as to say, \"Nevertheless, friend\n"
 "Peleg, I can stand it; yes, I can.\"  As for Peleg himself, he took it\n"
 "more like a philosopher; but for all his philosophy, there was a tear\n"
 "twinkling in his eye, when the lantern came too near. And he, too, did\n"
 "not a little run from cabin to deck - now a word below, and now a word\n"
 "with Starbuck, the chief mate.  But, at last, he turned to his\n"
 "comrade, with a final sort of look about him, - \"Captain Bildad -\n"
 "come, old shipmate, we must go. Back the main-yard there! Boat ahoy!\n"
 "Stand by to come close alongside, now! Careful, careful! - come,\n"
 "Bildad, boy - say your last. Luck to ye, Starbuck - luck to ye,\n"
 "Mr. Stubb - luck to ye,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Mr. Flask - good-bye, and good luck to ye all - and this day\n"
 "three years I'll have a hot supper smoking for ye in old\n"
 "Nantucket. Hurrah and away!\"  \"God bless ye, and have ye in His holy\n"
 "keeping, men,\" murmured old Bildad, almost incoherently. \"I hope ye'll\n"
 "have fine weather now, so that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among\n"
 "ye - a pleasant sun is all he needs, and ye'll have plenty of them in\n"
 "the tropic voyage ye go. Be careful in the hunt, ye mates.  Don't\n"
 "stave the boats needlessly, ye harpooneers; good white cedar plank is\n"
 "raised full three per cent. within the year. Don't forget your\n"
 "prayers, either.  Mr Starbuck, mind that cooper don't waste the spare\n"
 "staves. Oh! the sail-needles are in the green locker! Don't whale it\n"
 "too much a' Lord's days, men; but don't miss a fair chance either,\n"
 "that's rejecting Heaven's good gifts. Have an eye to the molasses\n"
 "tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a little leaky, I thought. If ye touch at\n"
 "the islands, Mr. Flask, beware of fornication. Good-bye, good-bye!\n"
 "Don't keep that cheese too long down in the hold, Mr. Starbuck; it'll\n"
 "spoil. Be careful with the butter - twenty cents the pound it was, and\n"
 "mind ye, if - \" \"Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering, - away!\"\n"
 "and with that, Peleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt into\n"
 "the boat.  Ship and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew\n"
 "between; a screaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled;\n"
 "we gave three heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate into\n"
 "the lone Atlantic.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Some chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall,\n"
 "new-landed mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.  When on\n"
 "that shivering winter's night, the Pequod thrust her vindictive bows\n"
 "into the cold malicious waves, who should I see\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " standing at her helm but Bulkington! I looked with\n"
 "sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man, who in mid-winter just\n"
 "landed from a four years' dangerous voyage, could so unrestingly push\n"
 "off again for still another tempestuous term. The land seemed\n"
 "scorching to his feet. Wonderfullest things are ever the\n"
 "unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs; this six-inch chapter\n"
 "is the stoneless grave of Bulkington. Let me only say that it fared\n"
 "with him as with the storm-tossed ship, that miserably drives along\n"
 "the leeward land.  The port would fain give succor; the port is\n"
 "pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm\n"
 "blankets, friends, all that's kind to our mortalities. But in that\n"
 "gale, the port, the land, is that ship's direst jeopardy; she must fly\n"
 "all hospitality; one touch of land, though it but graze the keel,\n"
 "would make her shudder through and through. With all her might she\n"
 "crowds all sail off shore; in so doing, fights 'gainst the very winds\n"
 "that fain would blow her homeward; seeks all the lashed sea's\n"
 "landlessness again; for refuge's sake forlornly rushing into peril;\n"
 "her only friend her bitterest foe!  Know ye, now, Bulkington? Glimpses\n"
 "do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth; that all deep,\n"
 "earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the\n"
 "open independence of her sea; while the wildest winds of heaven and\n"
 "earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous, slavish shore?  But as\n"
 "in landlessness alone resides the highest truth, shoreless, indefinite\n"
 "as God - so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite, than be\n"
 "ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety! For\n"
 "worm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of the\n"
 "terrible! is all this agony so vain?  Take heart, take heart, O\n"
 "Bulkington! Bear thee grimly, demigod! Up from the spray of thy\n"
 "ocean-perishing - straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of\n"
 "whaling; and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be\n"
 "regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable\n"
 "pursuit; therefore, I am all anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of\n"
 "the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales.  In the first\n"
 "place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact, that\n"
 "among people at large, the business of whaling is not accounted on a\n"
 "level with what are called the liberal professions. If a stranger were\n"
 "introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society, it would but\n"
 "slightly advance the general opinion of his merits, were he presented\n"
 "to the company as a harpooneer, say; and if in emulation of the naval\n"
 "officers he should append the initials S.  W. F. (Sperm Whale Fishery)\n"
 "to his visiting card, such a procedure would be deemed pre-eminently\n"
 "presuming and ridiculous.  Doubtless one leading reason why the world\n"
 "declines honoring us whalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our\n"
 "vocation amounts to a butchering sort of business; and that when\n"
 "actively engaged therein, we are surrounded by all manner of\n"
 "defilements. Butchers we are, that is true. But butchers, also, and\n"
 "butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all Martial Commanders whom\n"
 "the world invariably delights to honor. And as for the matter of the\n"
 "alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye shall soon be initiated into\n"
 "certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown, and which, upon the\n"
 "whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm whale-ship at least among the\n"
 "cleanliest things of this tidy earth. But even granting the charge in\n"
 "question to be true; what disordered slippery decks of a whale-ship\n"
 "are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battle-fields from\n"
 "which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies' plaudits? And if\n"
 "the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the\n"
 "soldier's profession; let me assure ye that many a veteran who has\n"
 "freely marched up to a battery, would quickly recoil at the apparition\n"
 "of the sperm whale's vast tail, fanning into eddies the air over his\n"
 "head. For what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the\n"
 "interlinked terrors and wonders of God!  But, though the world scouts\n"
 "at us whale hunters, yet does it unwittingly pay us the profoundest\n"
 "homage; yea, an all-abounding adoration! for almost all the tapers,\n"
 "lamps, and candles that burn round the globe, burn, as before so many\n"
 "shrines, to our glory!  But look at this matter in other lights; weigh\n"
 "it in all sorts of scales; see what we whalemen are, and have been.\n"
 "Why did the Dutch in DeWitt's time have admirals of their whaling\n"
 "fleets? Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense, fit\n"
 "out whaling ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town some\n"
 "score or two of families from our own island of Nantucket? Why did\n"
 "Britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in\n"
 "bounties upwards of lb. 1,000,000? And lastly, how comes it that we\n"
 "whalemen of America now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen\n"
 "in the world; sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels; manned\n"
 "by eighteen thousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000 of dollars; the\n"
 "ships worth, at the time of sailing, $20,000,000; and every year\n"
 "importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of $7,000,000. How\n"
 "comes all this, if there be not something puissant in whaling?  But\n"
 "this is not the half; look again.  I freely assert, that the\n"
 "cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his life, point out one single\n"
 "peaceful influence, which within the last sixty years has operated\n"
 "more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken in one aggregate,\n"
 "than the high and mighty business of whaling. One way and another, it\n"
 "has begotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so continuously\n"
 "momentous in their sequential issues, that whaling may well be\n"
 "regarded as that Egyptian mother, who bore offspring themselves\n"
 "pregnant from her womb. It would be a hopeless, endless task to\n"
 "catalogue all these things. Let a handful suffice. For many\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " years past the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting\n"
 "out the remotest and least known parts of the earth. She has explored\n"
 "seas and archipelagoes which had no chart, where no Cook or Vancouver\n"
 "had ever sailed. If American and european men-of-war now peacefully\n"
 "ride in once savage harbors, let them fire salutes to the honor and\n"
 "glory of the whale-ship, which originally showed them the way, and\n"
 "first interpreted between them and the savages. They may celebrate as\n"
 "they will the heroes of Exploring Expeditions, your Cookes, Your\n"
 "Krusensterns; but I say that scores of anonymous Captains have sailed\n"
 "out of Nantucket, that were as great, and greater than your Cooke and\n"
 "your Krusenstern.  For in their succorless emptyhandedness, they, in\n"
 "the heathenish sharked waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded,\n"
 "javelin islands, battled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cooke\n"
 "with all his marines and muskets would not willingly have dared. All\n"
 "that is made such a flourish of in the old South Sea Voyages, those\n"
 "things were but the lifetime commonplaces of our heroic\n"
 "Nantucketers. Often, adventures which Vancouver dedicates three\n"
 "chapters to, these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the\n"
 "ship's common log. Ah, the world! Oh, the world!  Until the whale\n"
 "fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial, scarcely any\n"
 "intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe and the long\n"
 "line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific coast. It was the\n"
 "whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the Spanish\n"
 "crown, touching those colonies; and, if space permitted, it might be\n"
 "distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the\n"
 "liberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain, and\n"
 "the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts.  That great\n"
 "America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was given to the\n"
 "enlightened world by the whaleman. After its first blunder-born\n"
 "discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long shunned those shores as\n"
 "pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched there. The\n"
 "whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony. Moreover, in\n"
 "the infancy of the first Australian settlement, the emigrants were\n"
 "several times saved\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whale-ship\n"
 "luckily dropping an anchor in their waters. The uncounted isles of all\n"
 "Polynesia confess the same truth, and do commercial homage to the\n"
 "whale-ship, that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant,\n"
 "and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first\n"
 "destinations. If that double-bolted land, Japan, is ever to become\n"
 "hospitable, it is the whale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due;\n"
 "for already she is on the threshold.  But if, in the face of all this,\n"
 "you still declare that whaling has no aesthetically noble associations\n"
 "connected with it, then am I ready to shiver fifty lances with you\n"
 "there, and unhorse you with a split helmet every time.  The whale has\n"
 "no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you will say.  The\n"
 "whale no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler? Who wrote\n"
 "the first account of our Leviathan? Who but mighty Job! And who\n"
 "composed the first narrative of a whaling-voyage? Who, but no less a\n"
 "prince than Alfred the Great, who, with his own royal pen, took down\n"
 "the words from Other, the Norwegian whale-hunter of those times! And\n"
 "who pronounced our glowing eulogy in Parliament? Who, but Edmund\n"
 "Burke!  True enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils;\n"
 "they have no good blood in their veins.  No good blood in their veins?\n"
 "They have something better than royal blood there.  The grandmother of\n"
 "Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel\" afterwards, by marriage, Mary\n"
 "Folger, one of the old settlers of Nantucket, and the ancestress to a\n"
 "long line of Folgers and harpooneers - all kith and kin to noble\n"
 "Benjamin - this day darting the barbed iron from one side of the world\n"
 "to the other.  Good again; but then all confess that somehow whaling\n"
 "is not respectable.  Whaling not respectable? Whaling is imperial! By\n"
 "old English statutory law, the whale is declared \"a royal fish\".\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Oh, that's only nominal! The whale himself has never figured\n"
 "in any grand imposing way.  The whale never figured in any grand\n"
 "imposing way? In one of the mighty triumphs given to a Roman general\n"
 "upon his entering the world's capital, the bones of a whale, brought\n"
 "all the way from the Syrian coast, were the most conspicuous object in\n"
 "the cymballed procession.  Grant it, since you cite it; but, say what\n"
 "you will, there is no real dignity in whaling.  No dignity in whaling?\n"
 "The dignity of our calling the very heavens attest. Cetus is a\n"
 "constellation in the South! No more! Drive down your hat in presence\n"
 "of the Czar, and take it off to Queequeg! No more! I know a man that,\n"
 "in his lifetime, has taken three hundred and fifty whales. I account\n"
 "that man more honorable than that great captain of antiquity who\n"
 "boasted of taking as many walled towns.  And, as for me, if, by any\n"
 "possibility, there be any as yet undiscovered prime thing in me; if I\n"
 "shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high hushed world\n"
 "which I might not be unreasonably ambitious of; if hereafter I shall\n"
 "do anything that, upon the whole, a man might rather have done than to\n"
 "have left undone; if, at my death, my executors, or more properly my\n"
 "creditors, find any precious MSS. in my desk, then here I\n"
 "prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory to whaling; for a\n"
 "whale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " In behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance\n"
 "naught but substantiated facts. But after embattling his facts, an\n"
 "advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " surmise, which might tell eloquently upon his cause - such an\n"
 "advocate, would he not be blameworthy?  It is well known that at the\n"
 "coronation of kings and queens, even modern ones, a certain curious\n"
 "process of seasoning them for their functions is gone through.  There\n"
 "is a saltcellar of state, so called, and there may be a caster of\n"
 "state.  How they use the salt, precisely - who knows? Certain I am,\n"
 "however, that a king's head is solemnly oiled at his coronation, even\n"
 "as a head of salad. Can it be, though, that they anoint it with a view\n"
 "of making its interior run well, as they anoint machinery? Much might\n"
 "be ruminated here, concerning the essential dignity of this regal\n"
 "process, because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly\n"
 "a fellow who anoints his hair, and palpably smells of that\n"
 "anointing. In truth, a mature man who uses hair-oil, unless\n"
 "medicinally, that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him\n"
 "somewhere. As a general rule, he can't amount to much in his totality.\n"
 "But the only thing to be considered here, is this - what kind of oil\n"
 "is used at coronations? Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar\n"
 "oil, nor castor oil, nor bear's oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver\n"
 "oil. What then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its\n"
 "unmanufactured, unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?\n"
 "\n"
 "Think of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings and\n"
 "queens with coronation stuff!\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of\n"
 "Nantucket, and a Quaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and\n"
 "though born on an icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot\n"
 "latitudes, his flesh being hard as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to\n"
 "the Indies, his live blood would not spoil like bottled\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " ale. He must have been born in some time of general drought\n"
 "and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which his state is\n"
 "famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those summers had\n"
 "dried up all his physical superfluousness. But this, his thinness, so\n"
 "to speak, seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares,\n"
 "than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight. It was merely the\n"
 "condensation of the man. He was by no means ill-looking; quite the\n"
 "contrary. His pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and closely\n"
 "wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength, like a\n"
 "revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long\n"
 "ages to come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow or\n"
 "torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was\n"
 "warranted to do well in all climates. Looking into his eyes, you\n"
 "seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold\n"
 "perils he had calmly confronted through life. A staid, steadfast man,\n"
 "whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and\n"
 "not a tame chapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and\n"
 "fortitude, there were certain qualities in him which at times\n"
 "affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the\n"
 "rest. Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep\n"
 "natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did\n"
 "therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that sort of\n"
 "superstition, which in some organizations seems rather to spring,\n"
 "somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance. Outward portents and\n"
 "inward presentiments were his. And if at times these things bent the\n"
 "welded iron of his soul, much more did his far- away domestic memories\n"
 "of his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend him still more from the\n"
 "original ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to those\n"
 "latent influences which, in some honest-hearted men, restrain the gush\n"
 "of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more perilous\n"
 "vicissitudes of the fishery. \"I will have no man in my boat,\" said\n"
 "Starbuck, \"who is not afraid of a whale.\" By this, he seemed to mean,\n"
 "not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which\n"
 "arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril, but that an\n"
 "utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"Aye, aye,\" said Stubb, the second mate, \"Starbuck, there, is\n"
 "as careful a man as you'll find anywhere in this fishery.\" But we\n"
 "shall ere long see what that word \"careful\" precisely means when used\n"
 "by a man like Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.  Starbuck was\n"
 "no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a sentiment; but a\n"
 "thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon all mortally\n"
 "practical occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in this\n"
 "business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits of\n"
 "the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly\n"
 "wasted. Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after\n"
 "sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much\n"
 "persisted in fighting him. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this\n"
 "critical ocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by\n"
 "them for theirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck\n"
 "well knew. What doom was his own father's? Where, in the bottomless\n"
 "deeps, could he find the torn limbs of his brother?  With memories\n"
 "like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain\n"
 "superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck\n"
 "which could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been\n"
 "extreme. But it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized,\n"
 "and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was\n"
 "not in nature that these things should fail in latently engendering an\n"
 "element in him, which, under suitable circumstances, would break out\n"
 "from its confinement, and burn all his courage up. And brave as he\n"
 "might be, it was that sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some\n"
 "intrepid men, which, while generally abiding firm in the conflict with\n"
 "seas, or winds, or whales, or any of the ordinary irrational horrors\n"
 "of the world, yet cannot withstand those more terrific, because more\n"
 "spiritual terrors, which sometimes menace you from the concentrating\n"
 "brow of an enraged and mighty man.  But were the coming narrative to\n"
 "reveal, in any instance, the complete abasement of poor Starbuck's\n"
 "fortitude, scarce might I have the heart to write it; for it is a\n"
 "thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose the fall of valor in the\n"
 "soul. Men may seem detestable as joint stock-companies and nations;\n"
 "knaves,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " fools, and murderers there may be; men may have mean and\n"
 "meagre faces; but man, in the ideal, is so noble and so sparkling,\n"
 "such a grand and glowing creature, that over any ignominious blemish\n"
 "in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes. That\n"
 "immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves, so far within us, that\n"
 "it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone; bleeds\n"
 "with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor-ruined\n"
 "man. Nor can piety itself, at such a shameful sight, completely stifle\n"
 "her upbraidings against the permitting stars. But this august dignity\n"
 "I treat of, is not the dignity of kings and robes, but that abounding\n"
 "dignity which has no robed investiture. Thou shalt see it shining in\n"
 "the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike; that democratic dignity\n"
 "which, on all hands, radiates without end from God; Himself! The great\n"
 "God absolute! The centre and circumference of all democracy! His\n"
 "omnipresence, our divine equality!  If, then, to meanest mariners, and\n"
 "renegades and castaways, I shall hereafter ascribe high qualities,\n"
 "though dark; weave round them tragic graces; if even the most\n"
 "mournful, perchance the most abased, among them all, shall at times\n"
 "lift himself to the exalted mounts; if I shall touch that workman's\n"
 "arm with some ethereal light; if I shall spread a rainbow over his\n"
 "disastrous set of sun; then against all mortal critics bear me out in\n"
 "it, thou just spirit of equality, which hast spread one royal mantle\n"
 "of humanity over all my kind! Bear me out in it, thou great democratic\n"
 "God! who didst not refuse to the swart convict, Bunyan, the pale,\n"
 "poetic pearl; Thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of\n"
 "finest gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes; Thou who\n"
 "didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon\n"
 "a war- horse; who didst thunder him higher than a throne! Thou who, in\n"
 "all Thy mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest Thy selectest\n"
 "champions from the kingly commons; bear me out in it, O God!\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Stubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and\n"
 "hence, according to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod- man. A\n"
 "happy-go-lucky; neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they came\n"
 "with an indifferent air; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis\n"
 "of the chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner\n"
 "engaged for the year. Good- humored, easy, and careless, he presided\n"
 "over his whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner,\n"
 "and his crew all invited guests. He was as particular about the\n"
 "comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat, as an old\n"
 "stage-driver is about the snugness of his box. When close to the\n"
 "whale, in the very death-lock of the fight, he handled his unpitying\n"
 "lance coolly and off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer. He\n"
 "would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the\n"
 "most exasperated monster. Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted\n"
 "the jaws of death into an easy chair. What he thought of death itself,\n"
 "there is no telling. Whether he ever thought of it at all, might be a\n"
 "question; but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a\n"
 "comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a\n"
 "sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves\n"
 "there, about something which he would find out when he obeyed the\n"
 "order, and not sooner.  What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb\n"
 "such an easygoing, unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the\n"
 "burden of life in a world full of grave peddlers, all bowed to the\n"
 "ground with their packs; what helped to bring about that almost\n"
 "impious good-humor of his; that thing must have been his pipe. For,\n"
 "like his nose, his short, black little pipe was one of the regular\n"
 "features of his face. You would almost as soon have expected him to\n"
 "turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " He kept a whole row of pipes there ready loaded, stuck in a\n"
 "rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever he turned in, he\n"
 "smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from the other to the\n"
 "end of the chapter; then loading them again to be in readiness\n"
 "anew. For, when Stubb dressed, instead of first putting his legs into\n"
 "his trowsers, he put his pipe into his mouth.  I say this continual\n"
 "smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his peculiar\n"
 "disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air, whether ashore\n"
 "or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the\n"
 "numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in time of the\n"
 "cholera, some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their\n"
 "mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal tribulations, Stubb's tobacco\n"
 "smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent.  The third\n"
 "mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha's Vineyard. A short,\n"
 "stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales, who\n"
 "somehow seemed to think that the great Leviathans had personally and\n"
 "hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of\n"
 "honor with him, to destroy them whenever encountered. So utterly lost\n"
 "was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their\n"
 "majestic bulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an\n"
 "apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them; that in\n"
 "his poor opinion, the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified\n"
 "mouse, or at least water-rat, requiring only a little circumvention\n"
 "and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and\n"
 "boil. This ignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little\n"
 "waggish in the matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of\n"
 "it; and a three years' voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke\n"
 "that lasted that length of time. As a carpenter's nails are divided\n"
 "into wrought nails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly\n"
 "divided. Little Flask was one of the wrought ones; made to clinch\n"
 "tight and last long. They called him King-Post on board of the Pequod;\n"
 "because, in form, he could be well likened to the short, square timber\n"
 "known by that name in Arctic whalers; and which by the means of many\n"
 "radiating side timbers inserted in it, served to brace the ship\n"
 "against the icy concussions of those battering seas.  Now these three\n"
 "mates - Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " momentous men. They it was who by universal prescription\n"
 "commanded three of the Pequod's boats as headsmen. In that grand order\n"
 "of battle in which Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to\n"
 "descend on the whales, these three headsmen were as captains of\n"
 "companies. Or, being armed with their long keen whaling spears, they\n"
 "were as a picked trio of lancers; even as the harpooneers were\n"
 "flingers of javelins.  And since in this famous fishery, each mate or\n"
 "headsman, like a Gothic Knight of old, is always accompanied by his\n"
 "boat-steerer or harpooneer, who in certain conjunctures provides him\n"
 "with a fresh lance, when the former one has been badly twisted, or\n"
 "elbowed in the assault; and moreover, as there generally subsists\n"
 "between the two, a close intimacy and friendliness; it is therefore\n"
 "but meet, that in this place we set down who the Pequod's harpooneers\n"
 "were, and to what headsman each of them belonged.  First of all was\n"
 "Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected for his\n"
 "squire. But Queequeg is already known.  Next was Tashtego, an unmixed\n"
 "Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly promontory of Martha's\n"
 "Vineyard, where there still exists the last remnant of a village of\n"
 "red men, which has long supplied the neighboring island of Nantucket\n"
 "with many of her most daring harpooneers. In the fishery, they usually\n"
 "go by the generic name of Gay-Headers. Tashtego's long, lean, sable\n"
 "hair, his high cheek bones, and black rounding eyes - for an Indian,\n"
 "Oriental in their largeness, but Antarctic in their glittering\n"
 "expression - all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the\n"
 "unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest of the\n"
 "great New England moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal\n"
 "forests of the main. But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild\n"
 "beasts of the woodland, Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great\n"
 "whales of the sea; the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the\n"
 "infallible arrow of the sires. To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe\n"
 "snaky limbs, you would almost have credited the superstitions of some\n"
 "of the earlier Puritans, and half believed this wild Indian to be a\n"
 "son of the Prince of the Powers of the Air.  Tashtego was Stubb the\n"
 "second mate's Squire.  Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a\n"
 "gigantic, coal- black\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " negro-savage, with a lion-like tread - an Ahasuerus to\n"
 "behold. Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that\n"
 "the sailors called them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the\n"
 "top-sail halyards to them. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped\n"
 "on board of a whaler, lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And\n"
 "never having been anywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and\n"
 "the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen; and having now led for\n"
 "many years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners\n"
 "uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped; daggoo retained\n"
 "all his barbaric virtues, and erect as a giraffe, moved about the\n"
 "decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks. There was a\n"
 "corporeal humility in looking up at him; and a white man standing\n"
 "before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a\n"
 "fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus Daggoo, was\n"
 "the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a chess-man beside him. As\n"
 "for the residue of the Pequod's company, be it said, that at the\n"
 "present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast\n"
 "employed in the American whale fishery, are Americans born, though\n"
 "pretty nearly all the officers are. Herein it is the same with the\n"
 "American whale fishery as with the American army and military and\n"
 "merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the\n"
 "construction of the American Canals and Railroads. The same, I say,\n"
 "because in all these cases the native American liberally provides the\n"
 "brains, the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles. No\n"
 "small number of these whaling seamen belong to the Azores, where the\n"
 "outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their\n"
 "crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores. In like manner,\n"
 "the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the\n"
 "Shetland Islands, to receive the full complement of their crew. Upon\n"
 "the passage homewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is\n"
 "no telling, but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were\n"
 "nearly all Islanders in the Pequod, Isolatoes too, I call such, not\n"
 "acknowledging the common continent of men, but each Isolato living on\n"
 "a separate continent of his own. Yet now, federated along one keel,\n"
 "what a set these Isolatoes were! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from\n"
 "all the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " isles of the sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying\n"
 "Old Ahab in the pequod to lay the world's grievances before that bar\n"
 "from which not very many of them ever come back. Black Little Pip - he\n"
 "never did - oh, no! he went before.  Poor Alabama boy! On the grim\n"
 "Pequod's forecastle, ye shall ere long see him, beating his\n"
 "tambourine; prelusive of the eternal time, when sent for, to the great\n"
 "quarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in with angels, and beat his\n"
 "tambourine in glory; called a coward here, hailed a hero there!\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above\n"
 "hatches was seen of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each\n"
 "other at the watches, and for aught that could be seen to the\n"
 "contrary, they seemed to be the only commanders of the ship; only they\n"
 "sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory,\n"
 "that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously. Yes, their\n"
 "supreme lord and dictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any\n"
 "eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the\n"
 "cabin.  Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I\n"
 "instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my\n"
 "first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the\n"
 "seclusion of the sea, became almost a perturbation. This was strangely\n"
 "heightened at times by the ragged Elijah's diabolical incoherences\n"
 "uninvitedly recurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have\n"
 "before conceived of. But poorly could I withstand them, much as in\n"
 "other moods I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities\n"
 "of that outlandish prophet of the wharves. But whatever it was of\n"
 "apprehensiveness or uneasiness - to call it so - which I felt, yet\n"
 "whenever I came to look about me in the ship, it seemed against all\n"
 "warrantry to\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " cherish such emotions. For though the harpooneers, with the\n"
 "great body of the crew, were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and\n"
 "motley set than any of the tame merchant-ship companies which my\n"
 "previous experiences had made me acquainted with, still I ascribed\n"
 "this - and rightly ascribed it - to the fierce uniqueness of the very\n"
 "nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in which I had so\n"
 "abandonedly embarked. But it was especially the aspect of the three\n"
 "chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was most forcibly\n"
 "calculated to allay these colorless misgivings, and induce confidence\n"
 "and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage. Three better,\n"
 "more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own different way, could\n"
 "not readily be found, and they were every one of them Americans; a\n"
 "Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it being Christmas when\n"
 "the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had biting Polar\n"
 "weather, though all the time running away from it to the southward;\n"
 "and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed, gradually\n"
 "leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable weather behind\n"
 "us. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey and gloomy\n"
 "enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the ship was\n"
 "rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and\n"
 "melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the\n"
 "forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail,\n"
 "foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran apprehension; Captain\n"
 "Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.  There seemed no sign of common\n"
 "bodily illness about him, nor of the recovery from any. He looked like\n"
 "a man cut away from the stake, when the fire has overrunningly wasted\n"
 "all the limbs without consuming them, or taking away one particle from\n"
 "their compacted aged robustness. His whole high, broad form, seemed\n"
 "made of solid bronze, and shaped in an unalterable mould, like\n"
 "Cellini's cast Perseus. Threading its way out from among his grey\n"
 "hairs, and continuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face\n"
 "and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you saw a slender\n"
 "rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that perpendicular seam\n"
 "sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when the\n"
 "upper lightning\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single twig,\n"
 "peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running off\n"
 "into the soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but\n"
 "branded. Whether that mark was born with him, or whether it was the\n"
 "scar left by some desperate wound, no one could certainly say. By some\n"
 "tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to\n"
 "it, especially by the mates. But once Tashtego's senior, an old\n"
 "Gay-Head Indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not till\n"
 "he was full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded, and then\n"
 "it came upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in an\n"
 "elemental strife at sea. Yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially\n"
 "negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man,\n"
 "who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this\n"
 "laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old sea-traditions, the\n"
 "immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old Manxman with\n"
 "preternatural powers of discernment. So that no white sailor seriously\n"
 "contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should be\n"
 "tranquilly laid out - which might hardly come to pass, so he muttered\n"
 "- then, whoever should do that last office for the dead, would find a\n"
 "birth-mark on him from crown to sole.  So powerfully did the whole\n"
 "grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the livid brand which streaked it,\n"
 "that for the first few moments I hardly noted that not a little of\n"
 "this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon\n"
 "which he partly stood. It had previously come to me that this ivory\n"
 "leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm\n"
 "whale's jaw. \"Aye, he was dismasted off Japan,\" said the old Gay-Head\n"
 "Indian once; \"but like his dismasted craft, he shipped another mast\n"
 "without coming home for it. He has a quiver of 'em.\"  I was struck\n"
 "with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of the\n"
 "Pequod's quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizen shrouds, there\n"
 "was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the plank. His\n"
 "bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and holding by a\n"
 "shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out beyond the\n"
 "ship's ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of firmest fortitude,\n"
 "a determinate unsurrenderable\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " wilfulness, in the fixed and fearless, forward dedication of\n"
 "that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor did his officers say aught to\n"
 "him; though by all their minutest gestures and expressions, they\n"
 "plainly showed the uneasy, if not painful, consciousness of being\n"
 "under a troubled master-eye. And not only that, but moody stricken\n"
 "Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face; in all the\n"
 "nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe.  Ere long, from\n"
 "his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin. But after that\n"
 "morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either standing in his\n"
 "pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or heavily walking\n"
 "the deck.  As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to grow a little\n"
 "genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as if, when the ship\n"
 "had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea\n"
 "had then kept him so secluded.  And, by and by, it came to pass, that\n"
 "he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet, for all that he\n"
 "said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he seemed as\n"
 "unnecessary there as another mast. But the Pequod was only making a\n"
 "passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling preparatives\n"
 "needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so that there\n"
 "was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite Ahab, now;\n"
 "and thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that layer upon\n"
 "layer were piled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose the loftiest\n"
 "peaks to pile themselves upon.  Nevertheless, ere long, the warm,\n"
 "warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant, holiday weather we came to,\n"
 "seemed gradually to charm him from his mood. For, as when the\n"
 "red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and May, trip home to the wintry,\n"
 "misanthropic woods; even the barest, ruggedest, most thunder-cloven\n"
 "old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts, to welcome\n"
 "such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did, in the end, a little respond\n"
 "to the playful allurings of that girlish air. More than once did he\n"
 "put forth the faint blossom of a look, which, in any other man, would\n"
 "have soon flowered out in a smile.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the\n"
 "Pequod now went rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at\n"
 "sea, almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August\n"
 "of the Tropic. The warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing,\n"
 "redundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped up\n"
 "- flaked up, with rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights\n"
 "seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely\n"
 "pride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden\n"
 "helmeted suns!  For sleeping man, 'twas hard to choose between such\n"
 "winsome days and such seducing nights. But all the witcheries of that\n"
 "unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the\n"
 "outward world. Inward they turned upon the soul, especially when the\n"
 "still mild hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals as the\n"
 "clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights. And all these subtle\n"
 "agencies, more and more they wrought on Ahab's texture.  Old age is\n"
 "always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less man has\n"
 "to do with aught that looks like death. among sea-commanders, the old\n"
 "greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night-cloaked\n"
 "deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he seemed so much\n"
 "to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits were more to\n"
 "the cabin, than from, the cabin to the planks. \"It feels like going\n"
 "down into one's tomb,\" - he would mutter to himself, - \"for an old\n"
 "captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my\n"
 "grave-dug berth.\"  So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the\n"
 "watches of the night were set, and the band on deck sentinelled the\n"
 "slumbers of the band below; and when if a rope was to be hauled upon\n"
 "the forecastle, the sailors flung it not rudely down, as by day,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " but with some cautiousness dropt it to its place, for fear of\n"
 "disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when this sort of steady\n"
 "quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the silent steersman\n"
 "would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old man would emerge,\n"
 "griping at the iron banister, to help his crippled way.  Some\n"
 "considerating touch of humanity was in him; for at times like these,\n"
 "he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because to his\n"
 "wearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel,\n"
 "such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony\n"
 "step, that their dreams would have been of the crunching teeth of\n"
 "sharks. But once, the mood was on him too deep for common regardings;\n"
 "and as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from\n"
 "taffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the odd second mate, came up from below,\n"
 "and with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if\n"
 "Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say\n"
 "nay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting\n"
 "something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the\n"
 "insertion into it, of the ivory heel.  Ah! Stubb, thou did'st not know\n"
 "Ahab then.  \"Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb,\" said Ahab, \"that thou wouldst\n"
 "wad me that fashion?  But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy\n"
 "nightly grave; where such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to\n"
 "the filling one at last. - Down, dog, and kennel!\"  Starting at the\n"
 "unforeseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful old man,\n"
 "Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly, \"I am not used to\n"
 "be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half like it, sir.\"\n"
 "\"Avast!\" gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving\n"
 "away, as if to avoid some passionate temptation.  \"No, sir; not yet,\"\n"
 "said Stubb, emboldened, \"I will not tamely be called a dog, sir.\"\n"
 "\"Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and\n"
 "begone, or I'll clear the world of thee!\"  As he said this, Ahab\n"
 "advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in his aspect, that\n"
 "Stubb involuntarily retreated.  \"I was never served so before without\n"
 "giving a hard blow for it,\" muttered Stubb, as he found himself\n"
 "descending the cabin-scuttle.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"It's very queer. Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don't well\n"
 "know whether to go back and strike him, or - what's that? - down here\n"
 "on my knees and pray for him?  Yes, that was the thought coming up in\n"
 "me; but it would be the first time I ever did pray. It's queer; very\n"
 "queer; and he's queer too; aye, take him fore and aft, he's about the\n"
 "queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with. How he flashed at me! - his\n"
 "eyes like powder-pans! is he mad? Anyway there's something on his\n"
 "mind, as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks. He\n"
 "aint in his bed now, either, more than three hours out of the\n"
 "twenty-four; and he don't sleep then. Didn't that Dough-Boy, the\n"
 "steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man's\n"
 "hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the\n"
 "foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort\n"
 "of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on it? A hot old\n"
 "man!  I guess he's got what some folks ashore call a conscience; it's\n"
 "a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say - worse nor a toothache. Well, well;\n"
 "I don't know what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it. He's\n"
 "full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for, every\n"
 "night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what's that for, I should\n"
 "like to know? Who's made appointments with him in the hold? Ain't that\n"
 "queer, now? But there's no telling, it's the old game - Here goes for\n"
 "a snooze. Damn me, it's worth a fellow's while to be born into the\n"
 "world, if only to fall right asleep. And now that I think of it,\n"
 "that's about the first thing babies do, and that's a sort of queer,\n"
 "too. Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of 'em. But\n"
 "that's against my principles. Think not, is my eleventh commandment;\n"
 "and sleep when you can, is my twelfth - So here goes again. But how's\n"
 "that? didn't he call me a dog? blazes! he called me ten times a\n"
 "donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of that! He might as well\n"
 "have kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he did kick me, and I didn't\n"
 "observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow. It\n"
 "flashed like a bleached bone. What the devil's the matter with me? I\n"
 "don't stand right on my legs.  Coming afoul of that old man has a sort\n"
 "of turned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming,\n"
 "though - How? how? how? - but the only way's\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " to stash it; so here goes to hammock again; and in the\n"
 "morning, I'll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by day-\n"
 "light.\"  When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over\n"
 "the bulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a\n"
 "sailor of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also\n"
 "his pipe. Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the\n"
 "stool on the weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.  In old\n"
 "Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were\n"
 "fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the Narwhale. How could\n"
 "one look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without\n"
 "bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized? For a Khan of the plank,\n"
 "and a king of the sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab.  Some\n"
 "moments passed, during which the thick vapor came from his mouth in\n"
 "quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face. \"How\n"
 "now,\" he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, \"this smoking no\n"
 "longer soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be\n"
 "gone! Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring, - aye,\n"
 "and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and\n"
 "with such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets\n"
 "were the strongest and fullest of trouble. What business have I with\n"
 "this pipe? This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild\n"
 "white vapors among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks\n"
 "like mine.  I'll smoke no more - \" He tossed the still lighted pipe\n"
 "into the sea. The fire hissed in the waves; the same instant the ship\n"
 "shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made. With slouched hat, Ahab\n"
 "lurchingly paced the planks.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Next morning Stubb accosted Flask.  \"Such a queer dream,\n"
 "King-Post, I never had. You know the old man's ivory leg, well I\n"
 "dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick back, upon my\n"
 "soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then, presto! Ahab\n"
 "seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it. But\n"
 "what was still more curious, Flask - you know how curious all dreams\n"
 "are - through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be\n"
 "thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that\n"
 "kick from Ahab. \"Why,\" thinks I,\"what's the row?  It's not a real leg,\n"
 "only a false leg.\" And there's a mighty difference between a living\n"
 "thump and a dead thump. That's what makes a blow from the hand, Flask,\n"
 "fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane. The living\n"
 "member - that makes the living insult, my little man. And thinks I to\n"
 "myself all the while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against\n"
 "that cursed pyramid - so confoundedly contradictory was it all, all\n"
 "the while, I say, I was thinking to myself, \"what's his leg now, but a\n"
 "cane - a whalebone cane. Yes,\" thinks I,\"it was only a playful\n"
 "cudgelling - in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me - not a base\n"
 "kick. Besides,\" thinks I,\"look at it once; why, the end of it - the\n"
 "foot part - what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed\n"
 "farmer kicked me, there's a devilish broad insult. But this insult is\n"
 "whittled down to a point only.\" But now comes the greatest joke of the\n"
 "dream, Flask. While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of\n"
 "badger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the\n"
 "shoulders, and slews me round. \"What are you 'bout?\" says he. Slid!\n"
 "man, but I was frightened. Such a phiz! But, somehow, next moment I\n"
 "was over the fright. \"What am I about?\" says I at last. \"And what\n"
 "business is that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback? Do you\n"
 "want a\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " kick?\" By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he\n"
 "turned round his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of\n"
 "seaweed he had for a clout - what do you think, I saw? - why thunder\n"
 "alive, man, his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points\n"
 "out. Says I, on second thoughts, oqq.I guess I won't kick you, old\n"
 "fellow.\" \"Wise Stubb,\" said he,\"wise Stubb;\" and kept muttering it all\n"
 "the time, a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag.  seeing\n"
 "he wasn't going to stop saying over his \"wise Stubb, wise Stubb,\" I\n"
 "thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I had\n"
 "only just lifted my foot for it, when he roared out, \"Stop that\n"
 "kicking!\" \"Halloa,\" says I, \"what's the matter now, old fellow?\" \"Look\n"
 "ye here,\" says he;\"let's argue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye,\n"
 "didn't he?\" \"Yes, he did,\" says I - \"right here it was.\" \"Very good,\"\n"
 "says he - \"he used his ivory leg, didn't he?\" \"Yes, he did,\" says\n"
 "I. \"Well then,\" says he, \"wise Stubb, what have you to complain of?\n"
 "Didn't he kick with right good will? it wasn't a common pitch pine leg\n"
 "he kicked with, was it? No, you were kicked by a great man, and with a\n"
 "beautiful ivory leg, Stubb. It's an honor; I consider it an\n"
 "honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In old England the greatest lords think it\n"
 "great glory to be slapped by a queen, and made garter-knights of; but,\n"
 "be your boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked by old Ahab, and made a wise\n"
 "man of. Remember what I say; be kicked by him; account his kicks\n"
 "honors; and on no account kick back; for you can't help yourself, wise\n"
 "Stubb. Don't you see that pyramid?\" With that, he all of a sudden\n"
 "seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to swim off into the air. I\n"
 "snored; rolled over; and there I was in my hammock! Now, what do you\n"
 "think of that dream, Flask?\"  \"I don't know; it seems a sort of\n"
 "foolish to me, tho'.\"  \"May be, may be. But it's made a wise man of\n"
 "me, Flask. D'ye see Ahab standing there, sideways looking over the\n"
 "stern? Well, the best thing you can do, Flask, is to let that old man\n"
 "alone; never speak to him, whatever he says. Halloa!  what's that he\n"
 "shouts? Hark!\"  \"Mast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye! There are\n"
 "whales hereabouts! If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!\"\n"
 "\"What d'ye think of that now, Flask? ain't there a small drop\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " of something queer about that, eh? a white whale - did ye\n"
 "mark that, man? Look ye - there's something special in the wind. Stand\n"
 "by for it, Flask. Ahab has that that's bloody on his mind. But, mum;\n"
 "he comes this way.\"  Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but\n"
 "soon we shall be lost in its unshored, harborless immensities. Ere\n"
 "that come to pass; ere the Pequod's weedy hull rolls side by side with\n"
 "the barnacled hulls of the Leviathan; at the outset it is but well to\n"
 "attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative\n"
 "understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations and\n"
 "allusions of all sorts which are to follow.  It is some systematized\n"
 "exhibition of the whale in his broad genera, that I would now fain put\n"
 "before you. Yet is it no easy task. The classification of the\n"
 "constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here essayed. Listen to what\n"
 "the best and latest authorities have laid down.  \"No branch of Zoology\n"
 "is so much involved as that which is entitled Cetology,\" says Captain\n"
 "Scoresby, A. D. 1820.  \"It is not my intention, were it in my power,\n"
 "to enter into the inquiry as to confusion exists among the historians\n"
 "of this animal\" (Sperm Whale), says Surgeon Beale, A. D. 1839.\n"
 "\"Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.\"\n"
 "\"Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea.\" \"A field\n"
 "strewn with thorns.\" \"All these incomplete indications but serve to\n"
 "torture us naturalists.\"  Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier,\n"
 "and John Hunter, and Lesson, those lights of zoology and\n"
 "anatomy. Nevertheless, though of real knowledge there be little, yet\n"
 "of books there are\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " a plenty; and so in some small degree, with cetology, or the\n"
 "science of whales.  many are the men, small and great, old and new,\n"
 "landsmen and seamen, who have at large or in little, written of the\n"
 "whale. Run over a few: - The Authors of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny;\n"
 "Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne; Gesner; Ray; Linnaeus; Rondeletius;\n"
 "Willoughby; Green; Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson; Marten; Lacepede;\n"
 "Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier; John Hunter;\n"
 "Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne; the Author of Miriam\n"
 "Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to what ultimate\n"
 "generalizing purpose all these have written, the above cited extracts\n"
 "will show.  Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those\n"
 "following Owen ever saw living whales; and but one of them was a real\n"
 "professional harpooneer and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the\n"
 "separate subject of the Greenland or Right-Whale, he is the best\n"
 "existing authority. But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the\n"
 "great Sperm Whale, compared with which the Greenland Whale is almost\n"
 "unworthy mentioning. And here be it said, that the Greenland Whale is\n"
 "an usurper upon the throne of the seas. He is not even by any means\n"
 "the largest of the whales. Yet, owing to the long priority of his\n"
 "claims, and the profound ignorance which, till some seventy years\n"
 "back, invested the then fabulous and utterly unknown Sperm-Whale, and\n"
 "which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few\n"
 "scientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation has been every\n"
 "way complete. Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the\n"
 "great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland Whale,\n"
 "without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas. But the time\n"
 "has at last come for a new proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear\n"
 "ye! good people all, - the Greenland Whale is deposed, - the great\n"
 "Sperm Whale now reigneth!  There are only two books in being which at\n"
 "all pretend to put the living Sperm Whale before you, and at the same\n"
 "time, in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt. Those books are\n"
 "Beale's and Bennett's; both in their time surgeons to English\n"
 "South-Sea whale-ships, and both exact and reliable men. The\n"

 " original matter touching the Sperm Whale to be found in their\n"
 "volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes, it is of\n"
 "excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific\n"
 "description. As yet, however, the Sperm Whale, scientific or poetic,\n"
 "lives not complete in any literature. Far above all other hunted\n"
 "whales, his is an unwritten life.  Now the various species of whales\n"
 "need some sort of popular comprehensive classification, if only an\n"
 "easy outline one for the present, hereafter to be filled in all its\n"
 "departments by subsequent laborers. As no better man advances to take\n"
 "this matter in hand, I hereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I promise\n"
 "nothing complete; because any human thing supposed to be complete,\n"
 "must for that very reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not pretend to\n"
 "a minute anatomical description of the various species, or - in this\n"
 "place at least - to much of any description. My object here is simply\n"
 "to project the draught of a systematization of cetology. I am the\n"
 "architect, not the builder.  But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary\n"
 "letter-sorter in the Post- office is equal to it. To grope down into\n"
 "the bottom of the sea after them; to have one's hands among the\n"
 "unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very pelvis of the world; this is a\n"
 "fearful thing. What am I that I should essay to hook the nose of this\n"
 "Leviathan! The awful tauntings in Job might well appal me. \"Will he\n"
 "(the Leviathan) make a covenant with thee? Behold the hope of him is\n"
 "vain!\" But I have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans; I\n"
 "have had to do with whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest;\n"
 "and I will try. There are some preliminaries to settle.  First: The\n"
 "uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is in the\n"
 "very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it still\n"
 "remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of\n"
 "Nature, A. D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, \"I hereby separate the whales\n"
 "from the fish.\" But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year\n"
 "1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnaeus's\n"
 "express edict, were still found dividing the possession of the same\n"
 "seas with the Leviathan.  The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain\n"
 "have banished\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the whales from the waters, he states as follows: \"On account\n"
 "of their warm bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids,\n"
 "their hollow ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,\" and\n"
 "finally, \"ex lege naturae jure meritoque.\" I submitted all this to my\n"
 "friends Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates\n"
 "of mine in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the\n"
 "reasons set forth were altogether insufficient. Charley profanely\n"
 "hinted they were humbug.  Be it known that, waiving all argument, I\n"
 "take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish, and call\n"
 "upon holy Jonah to back me. This fundamental thing settled, the next\n"
 "point is, in what internal respect does the whale differ from other\n"
 "fish. Above, Linnaeus has given you those items. But in brief, they\n"
 "are these: lungs and warm blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless\n"
 "and cold blooded.  Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious\n"
 "externals, so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To\n"
 "be short, then, a whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal\n"
 "tail. There you have him. However contracted, that definition is the\n"
 "result of expanded meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but\n"
 "the walrus is not a fish, because he is amphibious. but the last term\n"
 "of the definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the\n"
 "first. Almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to\n"
 "landsmen have not a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down\n"
 "tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail, though it may be\n"
 "similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal position.  By the\n"
 "above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude from the\n"
 "leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the\n"
 "whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other hand, link\n"
 "with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien. Hence,\n"
 "all the smaller, spouting,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this\n"
 "ground-plan of Cetology.  Now, then, come the grand divisions of the\n"
 "entire whale host.  First: According to magnitude I divide the whales\n"
 "into three primary BOOKS (subdivisible into Chapters), and these shall\n"
 "comprehend them all, both small and large.  I, The FOLIO WHALE;\n"
 "II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.  As the type of the\n"
 "FOLIO I present the Sperm Whale; of the OCTAVO, the Grampus; of the\n"
 "DUODECIMO, the Porpoise.  FOLIOS. Among these I here include the\n"
 "following chapters: - I. The Sperm Whale; II. the Right Whale;\n"
 "III. the Fin Back Whale; IV. the Hump-backed Whale; V. the Razor Back\n"
 "Whale; VI. the Sulphur Bottom Whale.  BOOK I. (Folio), Chapter\n"
 "I. (Sperm Whale). - This whale, among the English of old vaguely known\n"
 "as the Trumpa Whale, and the Physeter Whale, and the Anvil Headed\n"
 "Whale, is the present Cachalot of the French, and the Pottsfich of the\n"
 "Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words. He is, without\n"
 "doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe; the most formidable of all\n"
 "whales to encounter; the most majestic in aspect; and lastly, by far\n"
 "the most valuable in commerce; he being the only creature from which\n"
 "that valuable substance, spermaceti, is obtained. All his\n"
 "peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged upon. It is\n"
 "chiefly with his name that I now have to do. Philologically\n"
 "considered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm Whale was\n"
 "almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his\n"
 "oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those\n"
 "days spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived\n"
 "from a creature identical with the one then known in England as the\n"
 "Greenland or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same\n"
 "spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the\n"
 "first syllable of the word literally expresses. In those times, also,\n"
 "spermaceti was exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only\n"
 "as an ointment and medicament. It was only to be had from the\n"
 "druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine,\n"
 "in the course of time, the true nature of spermaceti became\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " known, its original name was still retained by the dealers;\n"
 "no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of\n"
 "its scarcity. And so the appellation must at last have come to be\n"
 "bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived.\n"
 "BOOK I. (Folio), Chapter II. (Right Whale). - In one respect this is\n"
 "the most venerable of the Leviathans, being the one first regularly\n"
 "hunted by man. It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or\n"
 "baleen; and the oil specially known as \"whale oil\", an inferior\n"
 "article in commerce. Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately\n"
 "designated by all the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland\n"
 "Whale; the Black Whale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right\n"
 "Whale. there is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the\n"
 "species thus multitudinously baptized. What then is the whale, which I\n"
 "include in the second species of my Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus\n"
 "of the English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of the English\n"
 "Whalemen; the Baliene Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the Growlands\n"
 "Walfish of the Swedes. It is the whale which for more than two\n"
 "centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic\n"
 "seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued\n"
 "in the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor' West Coast, and\n"
 "various other parts of the world, designated by them Right Whale\n"
 "Cruising Grounds.  Some pretend to see a difference between the\n"
 "Greenland Whale of the English and the Right Whale of the\n"
 "Americans. But they precisely agree in all their grand features; nor\n"
 "has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to\n"
 "ground a radical distinction. It is by endless subdivisions based upon\n"
 "the most inconclusive differences, that some departments of natural\n"
 "history become so repellingly intricate. The Right Whale will be\n"
 "elsewhere treated of at some length, with reference to elucidating the\n"
 "Sperm Whale.  BOOK I (Folio), Chapter III (Fin-Back). - Under this\n"
 "head I reckon a monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-\n"
 "Spout, and Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is\n"
 "commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by\n"
 "passengers crossing the Atlantic, in the New York\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and in his baleen,\n"
 "the Fin-back resembles the Right Whale, but is of a less portly girth,\n"
 "and a lighter color, approaching to olive. His great lips present a\n"
 "cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds of\n"
 "large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which\n"
 "he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object.  this fin is some\n"
 "three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of\n"
 "the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end. Even\n"
 "if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible, this\n"
 "isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the\n"
 "surface. When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with\n"
 "spherical ripples, and this gnomon- like fin stands up and casts\n"
 "shadows upon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the\n"
 "watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style\n"
 "and wavy hour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often\n"
 "goes back. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as\n"
 "some men are man-haters. Very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly\n"
 "rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters; his\n"
 "straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear\n"
 "upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in\n"
 "swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this Leviathan\n"
 "seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his\n"
 "mark that style upon his back. From having the baleen in his mouth,\n"
 "the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the Right Whale, among a\n"
 "theoretic species denominated Whalebone whales, that is, whales with\n"
 "baleen. Of these so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be\n"
 "several varieties, most of which, however, are little\n"
 "known. Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed whales;\n"
 "bunched whales; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales, are the\n"
 "fishermen's names for a few sorts.  In connexion with this appellative\n"
 "of \"Whalebone whales\", it is of great importance to mention, that\n"
 "however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating\n"
 "allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is in vain to attempt a clear\n"
 "classification of the Leviathan, founded upon either his baleen, or\n"
 "hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that those marked parts or\n"
 "features very\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a\n"
 "regular system of Cetology than any other detached bodily\n"
 "distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents. How then? The\n"
 "baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose\n"
 "peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of\n"
 "whales, without any regard to what may be the nature of their\n"
 "structure in other and more essential particulars. Thus, the Sperm\n"
 "Whale and the Humpbacked Whale, each has a hump; but there the\n"
 "similitude ceases. Then, this same Humpbacked Whale and the Greenland\n"
 "Whale, each of these has baleen; but there again the similitude\n"
 "ceases. And it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned.\n"
 "In various sorts of whales, they form such irregular combinations; or,\n"
 "in the case of any one of them detached, such an irregular isolation;\n"
 "as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a\n"
 "basis. On this rock every one of the whale-naturalists has split.  But\n"
 "it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the whale,\n"
 "in his anatomy - there, at least, we shall be able to hit the right\n"
 "classification.  Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the\n"
 "Greenland Whale's anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet we have\n"
 "seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the\n"
 "Greenland Whale. And if you descend into the bowels of the various\n"
 "Leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part\n"
 "as available to the systematizer as those external ones already\n"
 "enumerated. What then remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales\n"
 "bodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that\n"
 "way. And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted; and it is\n"
 "the only one that can possibly succeed, for it alone is\n"
 "practicable. To proceed.  BOOK I (Folio), Chapter IV (Hump Back). -\n"
 "this whale is often seen on the northern American coast. He has been\n"
 "frequently captured there, and towed into harbor. He has a great pack\n"
 "on him like a peddler; or you might call him the Elephant and Castle\n"
 "Whale. At any rate, the popular name for him does not sufficiently\n"
 "distinguish him, since the Sperm Whale also has a hump, though a\n"
 "smaller one. His oil is not very valuable. He has baleen. He is the\n"
 "most gamesome and light-hearted of all\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally\n"
 "than any other of them.  BOOK I (Folio), Chapter V (Razor Back). - Of\n"
 "this whale little is known but his name. I have seen him at a distance\n"
 "off Cape Horn. Of a retiring nature, he eludes both hunters and\n"
 "philosophers. Though no coward, he has never yet shown any part of him\n"
 "but his back, which rises in a long sharp ridge. Let him go. I know\n"
 "little more of him, nor does anybody else.  BOOK I (Folio), Chapter VI\n"
 "(Sulphur Bottom). - Another retiring gentleman, with a brimstone\n"
 "belly, doubtless got by scraping along the Tartarian tiles in some of\n"
 "his profounder divings. He is seldom seen; at least I have never seen\n"
 "him except in the remoter southern seas, and then always at too great\n"
 "a distance to study his countenance. He is never chased; he would run\n"
 "away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are told of him. Adieu,\n"
 "Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more that is true of ye, nor can the\n"
 "oldest Nantucketer.  Thus ends BOOK I (Folio), and now begins BOOK II\n"
 "(Octavo).  OCTAVOES. These embrace the whales of middling magnitude,\n"
 "among which at present may be numbered: - I, the Grampus; II, the\n"
 "Black Fish; III, the Narwhale; IV, the Thrasher; V, the Killer.  BOOK\n"
 "II (Octavo), Chapter I (Grampus). - Though this fish, whose loud\n"
 "sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to\n"
 "landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not\n"
 "popularly classed among whales. But possessing all the grand\n"
 "distinctive features of the Leviathan, most naturalists have\n"
 "recognised him for one. He is of moderate octavo size, varying from\n"
 "fifteen to twenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding dimensions\n"
 "round the waist.  He swims in herds; he is never regularly hunted,\n"
 "though his oil is considerable\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " in quantity, and pretty good for light. By some fishermen his\n"
 "approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great Sperm\n"
 "Whale.  BOOK II (Octavo), Chapter II (Black Fish). - I give the\n"
 "popular fishermen's names for all these fish, for generally they are\n"
 "the best. Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall\n"
 "say so, and suggest another. I do so now, touching the Black Fish, so\n"
 "called, because blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So,\n"
 "call him the Hyena Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known,\n"
 "and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved\n"
 "upwards, he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his\n"
 "face. This whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He\n"
 "is found in almost all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his\n"
 "dorsal hooked fin in swimming, which looks something like a Roman\n"
 "nose. When not more profitably employed, the Sperm Whale hunters\n"
 "sometimes capture the Hyena Whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil\n"
 "for domestic employment - as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence\n"
 "of company, and quite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow\n"
 "instead of odorous wax. Though their blubber is very thin, some of\n"
 "these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil.  BOOK II\n"
 "(Octavo), Chapter III (Narwhale), that is, Nostril Whale. - Another\n"
 "instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose from his\n"
 "peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The\n"
 "creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five\n"
 "feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen\n"
 "feet. Strictly speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing\n"
 "out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal. But\n"
 "it is only found on the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving\n"
 "its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed\n"
 "man. What precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would\n"
 "be hard to say. It does not seemed to be used like the blade of the\n"
 "sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the\n"
 "Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea\n"
 "for food. Charley Coffin said it was used for an ice-piercer; for the\n"
 "Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar Sea,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so\n"
 "breaks through. But you cannot prove either of these surmises to be\n"
 "correct. My own opinion is, that however this one-sided horn may\n"
 "really be used by the Narwhale - however that may be - it would\n"
 "certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading\n"
 "pamphlets. The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked Whale, the\n"
 "Horned Whale, and the Unicorn Whale. He is certainly a curious example\n"
 "of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated\n"
 "nature. From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this\n"
 "same sea-unicorn's horn was in ancient days regarded as the great\n"
 "antidote against poison, and as such, preparations of it brought\n"
 "immense prices. It was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting\n"
 "ladies, the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured\n"
 "into hartshorn. Originally it was in itself accounted an object of\n"
 "great curiosity.  Black Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on\n"
 "his return from that voyage, when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her\n"
 "jewelled hand to him from a window of Greenwich Palace, as his bold\n"
 "ship sailed down the Thames; when Sir Martin returned from that\n"
 "voyage, saith Black Letter, on bended knees he presented to her\n"
 "highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale, which for a long\n"
 "period after hung in the castle at Windsor. An Irish author avers that\n"
 "the Earl of Leicester, on bended knees, did likewise present to her\n"
 "highness another horn, pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn\n"
 "nature.  The Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being\n"
 "of a milk-white ground color, dotted with round and oblong spots of\n"
 "black. His oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little\n"
 "of it, and he is seldom hunted. He is mostly found in the circumpolar\n"
 "seas.  BOOK II (Octavo), Chapter IV (Killer). - Of this whale little\n"
 "is precisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the\n"
 "professed naturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I\n"
 "should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus. He is very\n"
 "savage - a sort of Feegee fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio\n"
 "Whales by the lip, and hangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute\n"
 "is worried to death. The Killer is never hunted. I never heard what\n"
 "sort of oil he has. Exception\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the\n"
 "ground of its indistinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on\n"
 "sea; Bonapartes and Sharks included.  BOOK II (Octavo), Chapter V\n"
 "(Thrasher). - This gentleman is famous for his tail, which he uses for\n"
 "a ferule in thrashing his foes. He mounts the Folio Whale's back, and\n"
 "as he swims, he works his passage by flogging him; as some\n"
 "schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process. Still less\n"
 "is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both are outlaws, even in\n"
 "the lawless seas.  Thus ends BOOK II (Octavo), and begins BOOK III\n"
 "(Duodecimo).  DUODECIMOES.These include the smaller whales. - I, The\n"
 "Huzza Porpoise; II, The Algerine Porpoise; III, The Mealy-mouthed\n"
 "Porpoise.  To those who have not chanced specially to study the\n"
 "subject, it may possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly\n"
 "exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among WHALES - a\n"
 "word, which, in the popular sense, always conveys an idea of\n"
 "hugeness. But the creatures set down above as Duodecimoes are\n"
 "infallibly whales, by the terms of my definition of what a whale is -\n"
 "i.e. a spouting fish, with a horizontal tail.  BOOK III (Duodecimo),\n"
 "Chapter I (Huzza Porpoise). - This is the common porpoise found almost\n"
 "all over the globe. The name is of my own bestowal; for there are more\n"
 "than one sort of porpoises, and something must be done to distinguish\n"
 "them.  I call them thus, because he always swims in hilarious shoals,\n"
 "which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps\n"
 "in a Fourth-of- July crowd. Their appearance is generally hailed with\n"
 "delight by the mariner. Full of fine spirits, they invariably come\n"
 "from the breezy billows to windward. They are the lads that always\n"
 "live before the wind. They are accounted a lucky omen. If you yourself\n"
 "can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish, then\n"
 "heaven help ye; the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye. A\n"
 "well-fed, plump Huzza Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good\n"
 "oil. But the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is\n"
 "exceedingly valuable. It is in request among jewellers and\n"
 "watchmakers.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Sailors put it on their hones. Porpoise meat is good eating,\n"
 "you know. It may never have occurred to you that a porpoise\n"
 "spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very readily\n"
 "discernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch him; and you\n"
 "will then see the great Sperm Whale himself in miniature.  BOOK III\n"
 "(Duodecimo), Chapter II (Algerine Porpoise). - A pirate. Very savage.\n"
 "He is only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is somewhat larger than\n"
 "the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general make. Provoke him,\n"
 "and he will buckle to a shark. I have lowered for him many times, but\n"
 "never yet saw him captured.  BOOK III (Duodecimo), Chapter III (Mealy-\n"
 "mouthed Porpoise). The largest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the\n"
 "Pacific, so far as it is known. The only English name, by which he has\n"
 "hitherto been designated, is that of the fishers - Right-Whale\n"
 "Porpoise, from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the\n"
 "vicinity of that Folio. In shape, he differs in some degree from the\n"
 "Huzza Porpoise, being of a less rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is\n"
 "of quite a neat and gentleman-like figure. He has no fins on his back\n"
 "(most other porpoises have), he has a lovely tail, and sentimental\n"
 "Indian eyes of a hazel hue. But his mealy-mouth spoils all. Though his\n"
 "entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary\n"
 "line, distinct as the mark in a ship's hull, called the \"bright\n"
 "waist\", that line streaks him from stem to stern, with two separate\n"
 "colors, black above and white below. The white comprises part of his\n"
 "head, and the whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he had\n"
 "just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag. A most mean and\n"
 "mealy aspect! His oil is much like that of the common porpoise.\n"
 "Beyond the Duodecimo, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the\n"
 "Porpoise is the smallest of the whales. Above, you have all the\n"
 "Leviathans of note. But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive,\n"
 "half-fabulous whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by\n"
 "reputation, but not personally. I shall enumerate them by their\n"
 "forecastle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to\n"
 "future investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun. If\n"
 "any of the following\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then he can\n"
 "readily be incorporated into this System, according to his Folio,\n"
 "Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude: - The Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk\n"
 "Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale;\n"
 "the Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the Elephant\n"
 "Whale; the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; etc. From\n"
 "Icelandic, Dutch, and old English authorities, there might be quoted\n"
 "other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth\n"
 "names. But I omit them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly help\n"
 "suspecting them for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying\n"
 "nothing.  Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would\n"
 "not be here, and at once, perfected. You cannot but plainly see that I\n"
 "have kept my word. But I now leave my cetological System standing thus\n"
 "unfinished, even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the\n"
 "crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower. For small\n"
 "erections may be finished by their first architects; grand ones, true\n"
 "ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity. God keep me from ever\n"
 "completing anything. This whole book is but a draught - nay, but the\n"
 "draught of a draught. Oh Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience! I am\n"
 "aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and\n"
 "Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are\n"
 "included by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish\n"
 "are a nosy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers,\n"
 "and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny\n"
 "their credentials as whales; and have presented them with their\n"
 "passports to quit the kingdom of Cetology. Why this book of whales is\n"
 "not denominated the Quarto is very plain. Because, while the whales of\n"
 "this order, though smaller than those of the former order,\n"
 "nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure, yet\n"
 "the bookbinder's Quarto volume in its diminished form does not\n"
 "preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume does.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as\n"
 "good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on\n"
 "ship-board, arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of\n"
 "officers, a class unknown of course in any other marine than the\n"
 "whale-fleet.  The large importance attached to the harpooneer's\n"
 "vocation is evinced by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch\n"
 "Fishery, two centuries and more ago, the command of a whale ship was\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain, but\n"
 "was divided between him and an officer called the\n"
 "Specksynder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in\n"
 "time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In those days, the\n"
 "captain's authority was restricted to the navigation and general\n"
 "management of the vessel: while over the whale-hunting department and\n"
 "all its concerns, the Specksynder or Chief Harpooneer reigned\n"
 "supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted title\n"
 "of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but his\n"
 "former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply as senior\n"
 "Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain's more inferior\n"
 "subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers\n"
 "the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since in the\n"
 "American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat, but\n"
 "under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling ground) the\n"
 "command of the ship's deck is also his; therefore the grand political\n"
 "maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart from the\n"
 "men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their\n"
 "professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as\n"
 "their social equal.  Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer\n"
 "and man at sea, is this - the first lives aft, the last\n"
 "forward. Hence, in whale-ships and merchantmen alike, the mates have\n"
 "their quarters with the captain; and so, too, in most of the American\n"
 "whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship. That\n"
 "is to say, they take their meals in the captain's cabin, and sleep in\n"
 "a place indirectly communicating with it.  Though the long period of a\n"
 "Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest of all voyages now or ever\n"
 "made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and the community of interest\n"
 "prevailing among a company, all of whom, high or low, depend for their\n"
 "profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their common luck, together\n"
 "with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and hard work; though all\n"
 "these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline\n"
 "than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind how much like an old\n"
 "Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some primitive instances,\n"
 "live together; for all that,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the punctilious externals, at least, of the quarter-deck are\n"
 "seldom materially relaxed, and in no instance done away. Indeed, many\n"
 "are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper parading his\n"
 "quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military\n"
 "navy; nay, extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the\n"
 "imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of pilot- cloth.  And though of\n"
 "all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least given to that\n"
 "sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage he ever\n"
 "exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he required no\n"
 "man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the\n"
 "quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to peculiar\n"
 "circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed, he\n"
 "addressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or in\n"
 "terrorem, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means\n"
 "unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.  Nor,\n"
 "perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind those\n"
 "forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself;\n"
 "incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than\n"
 "they were legitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism of\n"
 "his brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested;\n"
 "through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an\n"
 "irresistible dictatorship. For be a man's intellectual superiority\n"
 "what it will, it can never assume the practical, available supremacy\n"
 "over other men, without the aid of some sort of external arts and\n"
 "entrenchments, always, in themselves, more or less paltry and\n"
 "base. This it is, that for ever keeps God's true princes of the Empire\n"
 "from the world's hustings; and leaves the highest honors that this air\n"
 "can give, to those men who become famous more through their infinite\n"
 "inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert, than\n"
 "through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass.\n"
 "Such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political\n"
 "superstitions invest them, that in some royal instances even to idiot\n"
 "imbecility they have imparted potency. But when, as in the case of\n"
 "Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles\n"
 "an imperial brain;\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before the tremendous\n"
 "centralization.  Nor, will the tragic dramatist who would depict\n"
 "mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing, ever\n"
 "forget a hint, incidentally so important in his art, as the one now\n"
 "alluded to.  But Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his\n"
 "Nantucket grimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching\n"
 "Emperors and Kings, I must not conceal that I have only to do with a\n"
 "poor old whale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical\n"
 "trappings and housings are denied me. Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in\n"
 "thee, it must needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived for in the\n"
 "deep, and featured in the unbodied air!\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " It is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale\n"
 "loaf-of-bread face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his\n"
 "lord and master; who, sitting in the lee quarter- boat, has just been\n"
 "taking an observation of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the\n"
 "latitude on the smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that\n"
 "daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg. From his complete\n"
 "inattention to the tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not\n"
 "heard his menial. But presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds,\n"
 "he swings himself to the deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice,\n"
 "saying, \"Dinner, Mr.  Starbuck,\" disappears into the cabin.  When the\n"
 "last echo of his sultan's step has died away, and Starbuck, the first\n"
 "Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then Starbuck\n"
 "rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks, and,\n"
 "after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of\n"
 "pleasantness, \"Dinner, Mr. Stubb,\" and descends the scuttle. The\n"
 "second Emir lounges about the rigging\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " awhile, and then slightly shaking the main brace, to see\n"
 "whether it be all right with that important rope, he likewise takes up\n"
 "the old burden, and with a rapid \"Dinner, Mr. Flask\", follows after\n"
 "his predecessors.  But the third emir, now seeing himself all alone on\n"
 "the quarter-deck, seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint;\n"
 "for, tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions,\n"
 "and kicking off his shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless\n"
 "squall of a hornpipe right over the Grand Turk's head; and then, by a\n"
 "dexterous sleight, pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf,\n"
 "he goes down rollicking, so far at least as he remains visible from\n"
 "the deck, reversing all other processions, by bringing up the rear\n"
 "with music. But ere stepping into the cabin doorway below, he pauses,\n"
 "ships a new face altogether, and, then, independent, hilarious little\n"
 "Flask enters King Ahab's presence, in the character of Abjectus, or\n"
 "the Slave.  It is not the least among the strange things bred by the\n"
 "intense artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of\n"
 "the deck some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly\n"
 "and defyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let\n"
 "those very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner\n"
 "in that same commander's cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not\n"
 "to say deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head\n"
 "of the table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore\n"
 "this difference? A problem? Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King\n"
 "of Babylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but\n"
 "courteously, therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane\n"
 "grandeur. But he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit\n"
 "presides over his own private dinner-table of invited guests, that\n"
 "man's unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the\n"
 "time; that man's royalty of state transcends Belshazzar's, for\n"
 "Belshazzar was not the greatest. Who has but once dined his friends,\n"
 "has tasted what it is to be Caesar. It is a witchery of social\n"
 "czarship which there is no withstanding. Now, if to this consideration\n"
 "you superadd the official supremacy of a ship-master, then, by\n"
 "inference, you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sea-life\n"
 "just mentioned.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned\n"
 "sea-lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still\n"
 "deferential cubs. In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be\n"
 "served. They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab,\n"
 "there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance. With one mind,\n"
 "their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man's knife, as he carved\n"
 "the chief dish before him. I do not suppose that for the world they\n"
 "would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even\n"
 "upon so neutral a topic as the weather. No! And when reaching out his\n"
 "knife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, Ahab\n"
 "thereby motioned Starbuck's plate towards him, the mate received his\n"
 "meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little\n"
 "started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate; and chewed\n"
 "it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without circumspection. For,\n"
 "like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German Emperor\n"
 "profoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin\n"
 "meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at\n"
 "table old Ahab forbade not conversation; only he himself was\n"
 "dumb. What a relief it was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden\n"
 "racket in the hold below. And poor little Flask, he was the youngest\n"
 "son, and little boy of this weary family party. His were the shinbones\n"
 "of the saline beef; his would have been the drumsticks. For Flask to\n"
 "have presumed to help himself, this must have seemed to him tantamount\n"
 "to larceny in the first degree. Had he helped himself at that table,\n"
 "doubtless, never more would he have been able to hold his head up in\n"
 "this honest world; nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade\n"
 "him. And had Flask helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so\n"
 "much as noticed it.  Least of all, did flask presume to help himself\n"
 "to butter. Whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him,\n"
 "on account of its clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he\n"
 "deemed that, on so long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter was\n"
 "at a premium, and therefore was not for him, a subaltern; however it\n"
 "was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!  Another thing. Flask was the\n"
 "last person down at the dinner,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " and Flask is the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask's\n"
 "dinner was badly jammed in point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had\n"
 "the start of him; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in\n"
 "the rear. If Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens\n"
 "to have but a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding\n"
 "his repast, then Flask must bestir himself, he will not get more than\n"
 "three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to\n"
 "precede Flask to the deck. Therefore it was that Flask once admitted\n"
 "in private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an\n"
 "officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be\n"
 "otherwise than hungry, more or less.  For what he ate did not so much\n"
 "relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him.  Peace and\n"
 "satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach. I\n"
 "am an officer; but, how I wish I could fist a bit of old-fashioned\n"
 "beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before the\n"
 "mast. There's the fruits of promotion now; there's the vanity of\n"
 "glory: there's the insanity of life!  Besides, if it were so that any\n"
 "mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask's\n"
 "official capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample\n"
 "vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask\n"
 "through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before\n"
 "awful Ahab.  Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called\n"
 "the first table in the Pequod's cabin. After their departure, taking\n"
 "place in inverted order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was\n"
 "cleared, or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid\n"
 "steward. And then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they\n"
 "being its residuary legatees. They made a sort of temporary servants'\n"
 "hall of the high and mighty cabin.  In strange contrast to the hardly\n"
 "tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the\n"
 "captain's table, was the entire care-free license and ease, the almost\n"
 "frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers. While\n"
 "their masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of\n"
 "their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish\n"
 "that there was a report to it. They dined like lords; they filled\n"
 "their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices. Such\n"
 "portentous\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out the\n"
 "vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was\n"
 "fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of\n"
 "the solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go\n"
 "with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly\n"
 "way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back,\n"
 "harpoonwise. And once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted\n"
 "Dough-Boy's memory by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head\n"
 "into a great empty wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand,\n"
 "began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him. He was\n"
 "naturally a very nervous, shuddering sort of little fellow, this\n"
 "bread-faced steward; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital\n"
 "nurse. And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific\n"
 "Ahab, and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three\n"
 "savages, Dough-Boy's whole life was one continual\n"
 "lip-quiver. Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all\n"
 "things they demanded, he would escape from their clutches into his\n"
 "little pantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at them through the\n"
 "blinds of its door, till all was over.  It was a sight to see Queequeg\n"
 "seated over against Tashtego, opposing his filed teeth to the\n"
 "Indian's: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on the floor, for a bench\n"
 "would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low carlines; at\n"
 "every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin framework to\n"
 "shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in a ship. But for\n"
 "all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious, not to say\n"
 "dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small\n"
 "mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad,\n"
 "baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage fed\n"
 "strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through his\n"
 "dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by\n"
 "beef or by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a\n"
 "mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating - an ugly sound enough -\n"
 "so much so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether\n"
 "any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear\n"
 "Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " that his bones might be picked, the simple-witted Steward all\n"
 "but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry, by his\n"
 "sudden fits of the palsy. Nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers\n"
 "carried in their pockets, for their lances and other weapons; and with\n"
 "which whetstones, at dinner, they would ostentatiously sharpen their\n"
 "knives; that grating sound did not at all tend to tranquillize poor\n"
 "Dough-Boy. How could he forget that in his Island days, Queequeg, for\n"
 "one, must certainly have been guilty of some murderous, convivial\n"
 "indiscretions. Alas! Dough- Boy! hard fares the white waiter who waits\n"
 "upon cannibals. Not a napkin should he carry on his arm, but a\n"
 "buckler. in good time, though, to his great delight, the three\n"
 "salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to his credulous,\n"
 "fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones jingling in them at\n"
 "every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.  But, though these\n"
 "barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived there; still, being\n"
 "anything but sedentary in their habits, they were scarcely ever in it\n"
 "except at meal-times, and just before sleeping-time, when they passed\n"
 "through it to their own peculiar quarters.  In this one matter, Ahab\n"
 "seemed no exception to most American whale captains, who, as a set,\n"
 "rather incline to the opinion that by rights the ship's cabin belongs\n"
 "to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is, at any\n"
 "time, permitted there. So that, in real truth, the mates and\n"
 "harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to have lived\n"
 "out of the cabin than in it.  For when they did enter it, it was\n"
 "something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for a\n"
 "moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing,\n"
 "residing in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin\n"
 "was no companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though\n"
 "nominally included in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien\n"
 "to it. He lived in the world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in\n"
 "settled Missouri. And as when Spring and Summer had departed, that\n"
 "wild Logan of the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree,\n"
 "lived out the winter there, sucking his own paws; so, in his\n"
 "inclement, howling old age, Ahab's soul, shut up in the caved trunk of\n"
 "his body, there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom!\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation\n"
 "with the other seamen my first mast-head came round.  In most American\n"
 "whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost simultaneously with the\n"
 "vessel's leaving her port; even though she may have fifteen thousand\n"
 "miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground. and\n"
 "if, after a three, four, or five years' voyage she is drawing nigh\n"
 "home with anything empty in her - say, an empty vial even - then, her\n"
 "mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her skysail-poles\n"
 "sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether relinquish\n"
 "the hope of capturing one whale more.  Now, as the business of\n"
 "standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a very ancient and\n"
 "interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate here. I take it,\n"
 "that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old Egyptians;\n"
 "because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them. For though\n"
 "their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by their\n"
 "tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia, or\n"
 "Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great\n"
 "stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the\n"
 "dread gale of God's wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel\n"
 "builders priority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a\n"
 "nation of mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general\n"
 "belief among archaeologists, that the first pyramids were founded for\n"
 "astronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar\n"
 "stair-like formation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby,\n"
 "with prodigious long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers\n"
 "were wont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as\n"
 "the look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just\n"
 "bearing in sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit of\n"
 "old times, who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent\n"
 "the whole latter portion of\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground\n"
 "with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless\n"
 "stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by fogs\n"
 "or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything out\n"
 "to the last, literally died at his post. Of modern\n"
 "standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,\n"
 "and bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,\n"
 "are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon\n"
 "discovering any strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of\n"
 "the column of Vendo^me, stands with arms folded, some one hundred and\n"
 "fifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;\n"
 "whether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil.  Great\n"
 "Washington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in\n"
 "Baltimore, and like one of Hercules' pillars, his column marks that\n"
 "point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go. Admiral\n"
 "Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in\n"
 "Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke,\n"
 "token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is\n"
 "smoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor\n"
 "Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to\n"
 "befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze;\n"
 "however it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate through the\n"
 "thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must\n"
 "be shunned.  It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the\n"
 "mast-head standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in\n"
 "truth it is not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy,\n"
 "the sole historian of Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed\n"
 "tells us, that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were\n"
 "regularly launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island\n"
 "erected lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs\n"
 "ascended by means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in\n"
 "a hen- house. A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay\n"
 "whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to\n"
 "the ready-manned boats nigh the beach. But this custom has now become\n"
 "obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head, that of a\n"
 "whale-ship\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " at sea. The three mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise to\n"
 "sun- set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at the helm), and\n"
 "relieving each other every two hours. In the serene weather of the\n"
 "tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy\n"
 "meditative man it is delightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above\n"
 "the silent decks, striding along the deep, as if the masts were\n"
 "gigantic stilts, while beneath you and between your legs, as it were,\n"
 "swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships once sailed between\n"
 "the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes. There you stand, lost\n"
 "in the infinite series of the sea, with nothing ruffled but the\n"
 "waves. The tranced ship indolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow;\n"
 "everything resolves you into languor. For the most part, in this\n"
 "tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests you; you hear no\n"
 "news; read no gazettes; extras with startling accounts of commonplaces\n"
 "never delude you into unnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic\n"
 "afflictions; bankrupt securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled\n"
 "with the thought of what you shall have for dinner - for all your\n"
 "meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks, and your\n"
 "bill of fare is immutable.  In one of those southern whalemen, on a\n"
 "long three or four years' voyage, as often happens, the sum of the\n"
 "various hours you spend at the mast-head would amount to several\n"
 "entire months. And it is much to be deplored that the place to which\n"
 "you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural\n"
 "life, should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy\n"
 "inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of\n"
 "feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box,\n"
 "a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small and snug contrivances\n"
 "in which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your most usual point of\n"
 "perch is the head of the t' gallant-mast, where you stand upon two\n"
 "thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called the t'\n"
 "gallant cross-trees. Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner feels\n"
 "about as cosy as he would standing on a bull's horns. To be sure, in\n"
 "cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of\n"
 "a watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more\n"
 "of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " of its fleshly tabernacle, and cannot freely move about in\n"
 "it, nor even move out of it, without running great risk of perishing\n"
 "(like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a\n"
 "watch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or\n"
 "additional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest of\n"
 "drawers in your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of\n"
 "your watch-coat.  Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that\n"
 "the mast-heads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those\n"
 "enviable little tents or pulpits, called crow's-nests, in which the\n"
 "lookouts of a Greenland whaler are protected from the inclement\n"
 "weather of the frozen seas. In the fire-side narrative of Captain\n"
 "Sleet, entitled \"A Voyage among the Icebergs, in quest of the\n"
 "Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the re-discovery of the Lost\n"
 "Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;\" in this admirable volume, all\n"
 "standers of mast-heads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial\n"
 "account of the then recently invented crow's-nest of the Glacier,\n"
 "which was the name of Captain Sleet's good craft. He called it the\n"
 "Sleet's crow's-nest, in honor of himself; he being the original\n"
 "inventor and patentee, and free from all ridiculous false delicacy,\n"
 "and holding that if we call our own children after our own names (we\n"
 "fathers being the original inventors and patentees), so likewise\n"
 "should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may\n"
 "beget. In shape, the Sleet's crow's-nest is something like a large\n"
 "tierce or pipe; it is open above, however, where it is furnished with\n"
 "a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard\n"
 "gale. Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into it\n"
 "through a little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or side\n"
 "next the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker\n"
 "underneath for umbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a leather\n"
 "rack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and\n"
 "other nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his\n"
 "mast-head in this crow's nest of his, he tells us that he always had a\n"
 "rifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask\n"
 "and shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray Narwhales, or\n"
 "vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot\n"
 "successfully shoot at them from\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the deck owing to the resistance of the water, but to shoot\n"
 "down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it was plainly a labor\n"
 "of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the little\n"
 "detailed conveniences of his crow's-nest; but though he so enlarges\n"
 "upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very scientific\n"
 "account of his experiments in this crow's-nest, with a small compass\n"
 "he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting\n"
 "from what is called the \"local attraction\" of all binnacle magnets; an\n"
 "error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship's\n"
 "planks, and in the Glacier's case, perhaps, to there having been so\n"
 "many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though the\n"
 "Captain is very discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his learned\n"
 "\"binnacle deviations,\" \"azimuth compass observations,\" and\n"
 "\"approximate errors,\" he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was\n"
 "not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations, as to\n"
 "fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little\n"
 "case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow's nest,\n"
 "within easy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I greatly\n"
 "admire and even love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain; yet I\n"
 "take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that\n"
 "case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have\n"
 "been, while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the\n"
 "mathematics aloft there in that bird's nest within three or four\n"
 "perches of the pole.  But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so\n"
 "snugly housed aloft as Captain Sleet and his Greenland-men were; yet\n"
 "that disadvantage is greatly counterbalanced by the widely contrasting\n"
 "serenity of those seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly\n"
 "float. For one, I used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely,\n"
 "resting in the top to have a chat with Queequeg, or any one else off\n"
 "duty whom I might find there; then ascending a little way further, and\n"
 "throwing a lazy leg over the top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of\n"
 "the watery pastures, and so at last mount to my ultimate destination.\n"
 "Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept\n"
 "but sorry guard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how\n"
 "could I - being left completely to myself\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " at such a thought-engendering altitude, - how could I but\n"
 "lightly hold my obligations to observe all whale-ships' standing\n"
 "orders, \"Keep your weather eye open, and sing out every time.\"  And\n"
 "let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of\n"
 "Nantucket!  Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad\n"
 "with lean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness;\n"
 "and who offers to ship with the phaedon instead of Bowditch in his\n"
 "head. Beware of such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before\n"
 "they can be killed; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you\n"
 "ten wakes round the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the\n"
 "richer. Nor are these monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the\n"
 "whale-fishery furnishes !n asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and\n"
 "absent- minded young men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth,\n"
 "and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber. Childe Harold not\n"
 "unfrequently perches himself upon the mast-head of some luckless\n"
 "disappointed whale-ship, and in moody phrase ejaculates: - \"Roll on,\n"
 "thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll! Ten thousand blubber-hunters\n"
 "sweep over thee in vain.\" Very often do the captains of such ships\n"
 "take those absent-minded young philosophers to task, upbraiding them\n"
 "with not feeling sufficient \"interest\" in the voyage; half-hinting\n"
 "that they are so hopelessly lost to all honorable ambition, as that in\n"
 "their secret souls they would rather not see whales than\n"
 "otherwise. But all in vain; those young Platonists have a notion that\n"
 "their vision is imperfect; they are short-sighted; what use, then, to\n"
 "strain the visual nerve? They have left their opera-glasses at home.\n"
 "\"Why, thou monkey,\" said a harpooneer to one of these lads, \"we've\n"
 "been cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a\n"
 "whale yet. Whales are scarce as hen's teeth whenever thou art up\n"
 "here.\" Perhaps they were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of\n"
 "them in the far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like\n"
 "listlessness of vacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded\n"
 "youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he\n"
 "loses his identity; takes the mystic\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep, blue,\n"
 "bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature; and every strange,\n"
 "half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him; every dimly-\n"
 "discovered, uprising fin of some undiscernible form, seems to him the\n"
 "embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by\n"
 "continually flitting through it. In this enchanted mood, thy spirit\n"
 "ebbs away to whence it came; becomes diffused through time and space;\n"
 "like Cranmer's sprinkled Pantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of\n"
 "every shore the round globe over.  There is no life in thee, now,\n"
 "except that rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship; by her,\n"
 "borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from the inscrutable tides of\n"
 "God. But while this sleep, this dream is on ye, move your foot or hand\n"
 "an inch; slip your hold at all; and your identity comes back in\n"
 "horror. Over Descartian vortices you hover. And perhaps, at mid-day,\n"
 "in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled shriek you drop\n"
 "through that transparent air into the summer sea, no more to rise for\n"
 "ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Enter Ahab: Then, all It was not a great while after the\n"
 "affair of the pipe, that one morning shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as\n"
 "was his wont, ascended the cabin-gangway to the deck.  There most sea-\n"
 "captains usually walk at that hour, as country gentlemen, after the\n"
 "same meal, take a few turns in the garden.  \"Soon his steady, ivory\n"
 "stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old rounds, upon planks\n"
 "so familiar to his tread, that they were all over dented, like\n"
 "geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. Did you fixedly\n"
 "gaze, too, upon that ribbed\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " and dented brow; there also, you would see still stranger\n"
 "foot- prints - the foot-prints of his one unsleeping, ever-pacing\n"
 "thought.  But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper,\n"
 "even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full\n"
 "of his thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now\n"
 "at the main-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that\n"
 "thought turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so\n"
 "completely possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward\n"
 "mould of every outer movement.  \"D'ye mark him, Flask?\" whispered\n"
 "Stubb; \"the chick that's in him pecks the shell. T'will soon be out.\"\n"
 "The hours wore on; - Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing\n"
 "the deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.  It\n"
 "drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the\n"
 "bulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and\n"
 "with one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody\n"
 "aft.  \"Sir!\" said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never\n"
 "given on ship-board except in some extraordinary case.  \"Send\n"
 "everybody aft,\" repeated Ahab. \"Mast-heads, there! come down!\"  When\n"
 "the entire ship's company were assembled, and with curious and not\n"
 "wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike\n"
 "the weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly\n"
 "glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew,\n"
 "started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him\n"
 "resumed his heavy turns upon the deck.  With bent head and\n"
 "half-slouched hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering\n"
 "whispering among the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask,\n"
 "that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing\n"
 "a pedestrian feat. But this did not last long. Vehemently pausing, he\n"
 "cried: - \"What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?\"  \"Sing out for\n"
 "him!\" was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voices.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"Good!\" cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones;\n"
 "observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had\n"
 "so magnetically thrown them.  \"And what do ye next, men?\"  \"Lower\n"
 "away, and after him!\"  \"And what tune is it ye pull to, men?\"  \"A dead\n"
 "whale or a stove boat!\"  More and more strangely and fiercely glad and\n"
 "approving, grew the countenance of the old man at every shout; while\n"
 "the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling\n"
 "how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly\n"
 "purposeless questions.  But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab,\n"
 "now half-revolving in his pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a\n"
 "shroud, and tightly, almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them\n"
 "thus: - \"All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders\n"
 "about a White Whale.  Look ye! d'ye see this Spanish ounce of gold? -\n"
 "holding up a broad bright coin to the sun - it is a sixteen dollar\n"
 "piece, men. D'ye see it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top- maul.\"  While\n"
 "the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was slowly\n"
 "rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if to\n"
 "heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly\n"
 "humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and\n"
 "inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of\n"
 "his vitality in him.  Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he\n"
 "advanced towards the main-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand,\n"
 "exhibiting the gold with the other, and with a high raised voice\n"
 "exclaiming: Whosoever of ye raises me a white-headed whale with a\n"
 "wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw; whosoever of ye raises me that\n"
 "white-headed whale, with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke\n"
 "- look ye, whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale, he shall\n"
 "have this gold ounce, my boys!  \"Huzza! huzza!\" cried the seamen, as\n"
 "with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to\n"
 "the mast.  It's a white whale,\" I say, resumed Ahab, as he threw down\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the top-maul; a white whale. \"Skin your eyes for him, men;\n"
 "look sharp for white water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.\"  All\n"
 "this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even more\n"
 "intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of the\n"
 "wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was\n"
 "separately touched by some specific recollection.  \"Captain Ahab,\"\n"
 "said Tashtego, \"that white whale must be the same that some call Moby\n"
 "Dick.\"  \"Moby Dick?\" shouted Ahab. \"Do ye know the white whale then,\n"
 "Tash?\"  \"Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?\"\n"
 "said the Gay-Header deliberately.  \"And has he a curious spout, too,\"\n"
 "said Daggoo, \"very bushy, even for a parmacetty, and mighty quick,\n"
 "Captain Ahab?\"  \"And he have one, two, tree - oh! good many iron in\n"
 "him hide, too, Captain,\" cried Queequeg disjointedly, \"all twiske-tee\n"
 "betwisk, like him - him - \" faltering hard for a word, and screwing\n"
 "his hand round and round as though uncorking a bottle - \"like him -\n"
 "him - \" \"Corkscrew!\" cried Ahab, \"aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all\n"
 "twisted and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like\n"
 "a whole shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool\n"
 "after the great annual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails\n"
 "like a split jib in a squall.  Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick\n"
 "ye have seen - Moby Dick - Moby Dick!\"  \"Captain Ahab,\" said Starbuck,\n"
 "who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far been eyeing his superior with\n"
 "increasing surprise, but at last seemed struck with a thought which\n"
 "somewhat explained all the wonder. \"Captain Ahab, I have heard of Moby\n"
 "Dick - but it was not Moby Dick that took off thy leg?\"  \"Who told\n"
 "thee that?\" cried Ahab; then pausing, \"Aye, Starbuck; aye, my hearties\n"
 "all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that brought\n"
 "me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,\" he shouted with a\n"
 "terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose; \"Aye,\n"
 "aye! it was that accursed white whale that razeed me; made a poor\n"
 "pegging\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " lubber of me for ever and a day!\" Then tossing both arms,\n"
 "with measureless imprecations he shouted out: \"Aye, aye! and I'll\n"
 "chase him round Good Hope, and round the horn, and round the norway\n"
 "maelstrom, and round perdition's flames before I give him up. And this\n"
 "is what ye have shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both\n"
 "sides of land, and over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood\n"
 "and rolls fin out. What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now?\n"
 "I think ye do look brave.\"  \"Aye, aye!\" shouted the harpooneers and\n"
 "seamen, running closer to the excited old man: \"A sharp eye for the\n"
 "White Whale; a sharp lance for Moby Dick!\"  \"God bless ye,\" he seemed\n"
 "to half sob and half shout. \"God bless ye, men.  Steward! go draw the\n"
 "great measure of grog. But what's this long face about, Mr.  Starbuck;\n"
 "wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not game for Moby Dick?\"  \"I\n"
 "am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain\n"
 "Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I\n"
 "came here to hunt whales, not my commander's vengeance. How many\n"
 "barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain\n"
 "Ahab? it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.\"\n"
 "\"Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest a\n"
 "little lower layer. If money's to be the measurer, man, and the\n"
 "accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by\n"
 "girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then,\n"
 "let me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium here!\"\n"
 "\"He smites his chest,\" whispered Stubb, what's that for? methinks it\n"
 "rings most vast, but hollow.\"  \"Vengeance on a dumb brute!\" cried\n"
 "Starbuck, \"that simply smote thee from blindest instinct! Madness! To\n"
 "be enraged with a dumb thing, Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous.\"  \"Hark\n"
 "ye yet again, - the little lower layer. All visible objects, man, are\n"
 "but as pasteboard masks. But in each event - in the living act, the\n"
 "undoubted deed - there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts\n"
 "forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning\n"
 "mask. If man will strike, strike through\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the mask! How can the prisoner reach outside except by\n"
 "thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is that wall,\n"
 "shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there's naught beyond. But 'tis\n"
 "enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous strength,\n"
 "with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable thing is\n"
 "chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the white\n"
 "whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me of\n"
 "blasphemy, man; I'd strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the\n"
 "sun do that, then could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of\n"
 "fair play herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my\n"
 "master, man, is even that fair play.  Who's over me? Truth hath no\n"
 "confines. Take off thine eye! more intolerable than fiends' glarings\n"
 "is a doltish stare! So, so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has\n"
 "melted thee to anger-glow. But look ye, Starbuck, what is said in\n"
 "heat, that thing unsays itself. There are men from whom warm words are\n"
 "small indignity. I meant not to incense thee. Let it go. Look! see\n"
 "yonder Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn - living, breathing pictures\n"
 "painted by the sun. The Pagan leopards - the unrecking and\n"
 "unworshipping things, that live; and seek, and give no reasons for the\n"
 "torrid life they feel! The crew, man, the crew! Are they not one and\n"
 "all with Ahab, in this matter of the whale? See Stubb! he laughs! See\n"
 "yonder Chilian! he snorts to think of it. Stand up amid the general\n"
 "hurricane, thy one tost sapling cannot, Starbuck! And what is it?\n"
 "Reckon it. 'Tis but to help strike a fin; no wondrous feat for\n"
 "Starbuck. What is it more? From this one poor hunt, then, the best\n"
 "lance out of all Nantucket, surely he will not hang back, when every\n"
 "foremast-hand has clutched a whetstone? Ah! constrainings seize thee;\n"
 "I see! the billow lifts thee! Speak, but speak! - Aye, aye! thy\n"
 "silence, then, that voices thee. (Aside) something shot from my\n"
 "dilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in his lungs. Starbuck now is\n"
 "mine; cannot oppose me now, without rebellion.  \"God keep me! - keep\n"
 "us all!\" murmured Starbuck, lowly.  But in his joy at the enchanted,\n"
 "tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab did not hear his foreboding\n"
 "invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the hold; nor yet the presaging\n"
 "vibrations of\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the winds in the cordage; nor yet the hollow flap of the\n"
 "sails against the masts, as for a moment their hearts sank in. For\n"
 "again Starbuck's downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of\n"
 "life; the subterranean laugh died away; the winds blew on; the sails\n"
 "filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as before. Ah, ye admonitions\n"
 "and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come? But rather are ye\n"
 "predictions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not so much predictions\n"
 "from without, as verifications of the foregoing things within. For\n"
 "with little external to constrain us, the innermost necessities in our\n"
 "being, these still drive us on.  \"The measure! the measure!\" cried\n"
 "Ahab.  Receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers,\n"
 "he ordered them to produce their weapons. Then ranging them before him\n"
 "near the capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three\n"
 "mates stood at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship's\n"
 "company formed a circle round the group; he stood for an instant\n"
 "searchingly eyeing every man of his crew. But those wild eyes met his,\n"
 "as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their\n"
 "leader, ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison; but,\n"
 "alas! only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian.  \"Drink and\n"
 "pass!\" he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the nearest\n"
 "seaman. \"The crew alone now drink. Round with it, round! Short\n"
 "draughts - long swallows, men; 'tis hot as Satan's hoof. So, so; it\n"
 "goes round excellently. It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the\n"
 "serpent-snapping eye. well done; almost drained. That way it went,\n"
 "this way it comes. Hand it me - here's a hollow! Men, ye seem the\n"
 "years; so brimming life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill!  \"Attend\n"
 "now, my braves. I have mustered ye all round this capstan; and ye\n"
 "mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand there with\n"
 "your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may in some\n"
 "sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me. O men,\n"
 "you will yet see that - Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies come not\n"
 "sooner. Hand it me. Why, now, this pewter had run brimming again,\n"
 "wer't not thou St. Vitus' imp - away, thou ague!  \"Advance, ye mates!\n"
 "Cross your lances full before me. Well\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " done! Let me touch the axis.\" So saying, with extended arm,\n"
 "he grasped the three level, radiating lances at their crossed centre;\n"
 "while so doing, suddenly and nervously twitched them; meanwhile,\n"
 "glancing intently from Starbuck to Stubb; from Stubb to Flask. It\n"
 "seemed as though, by some nameless, interior volition, he would fain\n"
 "have shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the\n"
 "Leyden jar of his own magnetic life. The three mates quailed before\n"
 "his strong, sustained, and mystic aspect. Stubb and Flask looked\n"
 "sideways from him; the honest eye of Starbuck fell downright.  \"In\n"
 "vain!\" cried Ahab; \"but, maybe, 'tis well. For did ye three but once\n"
 "take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, that had\n"
 "perhaps expired from out me. Perchance, too, it would have dropped ye\n"
 "dead. Perchance ye need it not. Down lances! And now, ye mates, I do\n"
 "appoint ye three cup-bearers to my three pagan kinsmen there - yon\n"
 "three most honorable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant\n"
 "harpooneers. Disdain the task? What, when the great Pope washes the\n"
 "feet of beggars, using his tiara for ewer? Oh, my sweet cardinals!\n"
 "your own condescension, that shall bend ye to it. I do not order ye;\n"
 "ye will it. Cut your seizings and draw the poles, ye harpooneers!\"\n"
 "Silently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the\n"
 "detached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held,\n"
 "barbs up, before him.  \"Stab me not with that keen steel! Cant them;\n"
 "cant them over! know ye not the goblet end? Turn up the socket! So,\n"
 "so; now, ye cup-bearers, advance. The irons!  take them; hold them\n"
 "while I fill! Forthwith, slowly going from one officer to the other,\n"
 "he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter.\n"
 "\n"
 "\"Now, three to three, ye stand. Commend the murderous chalices! Bestow\n"
 "them, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league. Ha!\n"
 "Starbuck! but the deed is done! Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit\n"
 "upon it. Drink, ye harpooneers!  drink and swear, ye men that man the\n"
 "deathful whaleboat's bow - Death to Moby Dick! God hunt us all, if we\n"
 "do not hunt Moby Dick to his death!\" The long, barbed steel goblets\n"
 "were lifted; and to cries and maledictions against the white whale,\n"
 "the spirits\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss. Starbuck paled,\n"
 "and turned, and shivered. Once more, and finally, the replenished\n"
 "pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew; when, waving his free\n"
 "hand to them, they all dispersed; and Ahab retired within his cabin.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"

 "\n"
 " the spread through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the\n"
 "special individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to\n"
 "be doubted, that several vessels reported to have encountered, at such\n"
 "or such a time, or on such or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of\n"
 "uncommon magnitude and malignity, which whale, after doing great\n"
 "mischief to his assailants, had completely escaped them; to some minds\n"
 "it was not an unfair presumption, I say, that the whale in question\n"
 "must have been no other than moby Dick. Yet as of late the Sperm Whale\n"
 "fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of\n"
 "great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster attacked; therefore\n"
 "it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby\n"
 "Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were content to\n"
 "ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it were, to the perils\n"
 "of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the individual cause. In\n"
 "that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale\n"
 "had hitherto been popularly regarded.  And as for those who,\n"
 "previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance caught sight of him;\n"
 "in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them, almost, as\n"
 "boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any other whale of that\n"
 "species. But at length, such calamities did ensue in these assaults -\n"
 "not restricted to sprained wrists and ancles, broken limbs, or\n"
 "devouring amputations - but fatal to the last degree of fatality;\n"
 "those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and piling their\n"
 "terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake the\n"
 "fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White Whale\n"
 "had eventually come.  Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to\n"
 "exaggerate, and still the more horrify the true histories of these\n"
 "deadly encounters. For not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out\n"
 "of the very body of all surprising terrible events, - as the smitten\n"
 "tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in maritime life, far more than in\n"
 "that of terra firma, wild rumors abound, wherever there is any\n"
 "adequate reality for them to cling to. And as the sea surpasses the\n"
 "land in this matter, so the whale fishery surpasses every other sort\n"
 "of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only are\n"
 "whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness\n"
 "hereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they are by all odds\n"
 "the most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly\n"
 "astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its greatest\n"
 "marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such\n"
 "remotest waters, that though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a\n"
 "thousand shores, you would not come to any chiselled hearthstone, or\n"
 "aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and\n"
 "longitudes, pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is\n"
 "wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many\n"
 "a mighty birth.  No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the\n"
 "mere transit over the widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the\n"
 "White Whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of\n"
 "morbid hints, and half-formed foetal suggestions of supernatural\n"
 "agencies, which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors\n"
 "unborrowed from anything that visibly appears. So that in many cases\n"
 "such a panic did he finally strike, that few who by those rumors, at\n"
 "least, had heard of the White Whale, few of those hunters were willing\n"
 "to encounter the perils of his jaw.  But there were still other and\n"
 "more vital practical influences at work. Not even at the present day\n"
 "has the original prestige of the Sperm Whale, as fearfully\n"
 "distinguished from all other species of the leviathan, died out of the\n"
 "minds of the whalemen as a body. There are those this day among them,\n"
 "who, though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to\n"
 "the Greenland or Right Whale, would perhaps - either from professional\n"
 "inexperience, or incompetency, or timidity, decline a contest with the\n"
 "Sperm Whale; at any rate, there are plenty of whalemen, especially\n"
 "among those whaling nations not sailing under the American flag, who\n"
 "have never hostilely encountered the Sperm Whale, but whose sole\n"
 "knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster\n"
 "primitively pursued in the North; seated on their hatches, these men\n"
 "will hearken with a childish fire-side interest and awe, to the wild,\n"
 "strange tales of\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Southern whaling. Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of\n"
 "the great Sperm Whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on\n"
 "board of those prows which stem him.  And as if the now tested reality\n"
 "of his might had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before\n"
 "it; we find some book naturalists - Olassen and Povelson - declaring\n"
 "the Sperm Whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature\n"
 "in the sea, but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to\n"
 "be athirst for human blood. Nor even down to so late a time as\n"
 "Cuvier's, were these or almost similar impressions effaced. For in his\n"
 "Natural History, the Baron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm\n"
 "Whale, all fish (sharks included) are \"struck with the most lively\n"
 "terrors\", and \"often in the precipitancy of their flight dash\n"
 "themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause\n"
 "instantaneous death\". And however the general experiences in the\n"
 "fishery may amend such reports as these; yet in their full\n"
 "terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the\n"
 "superstitious belief in them is, in some vicissitudes of their\n"
 "vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.  So that overawed by\n"
 "the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few of the fishermen\n"
 "recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days of the Sperm\n"
 "Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised\n"
 "Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare;\n"
 "such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully\n"
 "pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the\n"
 "Sperm Whale was not for mortal man. That to attempt it, would be\n"
 "inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity. on this head, there are\n"
 "some remarkable documents that may be consulted.  Nevertheless, some\n"
 "there were, who even in the face of these things were ready to give\n"
 "chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who, chancing only to\n"
 "hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the specific details of any\n"
 "certain calamity, and without superstitious accompaniments, were\n"
 "sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered.  One of the\n"
 "wild suggestings referred to, as at last coming to be linked with the\n"
 "White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was the\n"
 "unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " ubiquitous; that he had actually been encountered in opposite\n"
 "latitudes at one and the same instant of time.  Nor, credulous as such\n"
 "minds must have been, was this conceit altogether without some faint\n"
 "show of superstitious probability. For as the secrets of the currents\n"
 "in the seas have never yet been divulged, even to the most erudite\n"
 "research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale when beneath the\n"
 "surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to his pursuers; and from\n"
 "time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory\n"
 "speculations regarding them, especially concerning the mystic modes\n"
 "whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he transports himself with\n"
 "such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points.  It is a thing\n"
 "well known to both American and English whale-ships, and as well a\n"
 "thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby, that\n"
 "some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose\n"
 "bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland\n"
 "seas. Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has\n"
 "been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could\n"
 "not have exceeded very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been\n"
 "believed by some whalemen, that the nor' west passage, so long a\n"
 "problem to man, was never a problem to the whale. So that here, in the\n"
 "real living experience of living men, the prodigies related in old\n"
 "times of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there\n"
 "was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the\n"
 "surface); and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain\n"
 "near Syracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy\n"
 "Land by an underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost\n"
 "fully equalled by the realities of the whaleman.  Forced into\n"
 "familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing that\n"
 "after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had escaped alive;\n"
 "it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go\n"
 "still further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only\n"
 "ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in time);\n"
 "that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he would\n"
 "still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout\n"
 "thick\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for\n"
 "again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied\n"
 "jet would once more be seen.  But even stripped of these supernatural\n"
 "surmisings, there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable\n"
 "character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted\n"
 "power. For, it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much\n"
 "distinguished him from other Sperm Whales, but, as was elsewhere\n"
 "thrown out - a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead, and a high,\n"
 "pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent features; the tokens\n"
 "whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he revealed his\n"
 "identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.  The rest of his\n"
 "body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the same shrouded\n"
 "hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive appellation of\n"
 "the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by his vivid\n"
 "aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea,\n"
 "leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden\n"
 "gleamings.  Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue,\n"
 "nor yet his deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with\n"
 "natural terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which,\n"
 "according to specific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in\n"
 "his assaults. More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of\n"
 "dismay than perhaps aught else. For, when swimming before his exulting\n"
 "pursuers, with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times\n"
 "been known to turn around suddenly, and, bearing down upon them,\n"
 "either stave their boats to splinters, or drive them back in\n"
 "consternation to their ship.  Already several fatalities had attended\n"
 "his chase. But though similar disasters, however little bruited\n"
 "ashore, were by no means unusual in the fishery; yet, in most\n"
 "instances, such seemed the White Whale's infernal aforethought of\n"
 "ferocity, that every dismembering or death that he caused, was not\n"
 "wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent.\n"
 "Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid\n"
 "the chips of chewed boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades,\n"
 "they swam out of the white curds of the whale's direful wrath into the\n"
 "serene, exasperating sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a\n"
 "bridal.  His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both\n"
 "whirling in the eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his\n"
 "broken prow, had dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his\n"
 "foe, blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep\n"
 "life of the whale. That captain was Ahab. And then it was, that\n"
 "suddenly sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick\n"
 "had reaped away Ahab's leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the\n"
 "field. No turbaned Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote\n"
 "him with more seeming malice. Small reason was there to doubt, then,\n"
 "that ever since that almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild\n"
 "vindictiveness against the whale, all the more fell for that in his\n"
 "frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him, not only all\n"
 "his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and spiritual\n"
 "exasperations. The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac\n"
 "incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel\n"
 "eating in them, till they are left living on with half a heart and\n"
 "half a lung. That intangible malignity which has been from the\n"
 "beginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe\n"
 "one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east\n"
 "reverenced in their statue devil; - Ahab did not fall down and worship\n"
 "it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred\n"
 "White Whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. All that\n"
 "most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all\n"
 "truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the\n"
 "brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to\n"
 "crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable\n"
 "in Moby Dick. He piled upon the whale's white hump the sum of all the\n"
 "general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and then,\n"
 "as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart's shell upon\n"
 "it.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " It is not probable that this monomania in him took its\n"
 "instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in\n"
 "darting at the monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a\n"
 "sudden, passionate, corporal animosity; and when he received the\n"
 "stroke that tore him, he probably but felt the agonizing bodily\n"
 "laceration, but nothing more. Yet, when by this collision forced to\n"
 "turn towards home, and for long months of days and weeks, Ahab and\n"
 "anguish lay stretched together in one hammock, rounding in mid winter\n"
 "that dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his torn body\n"
 "and gashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made him\n"
 "mad. That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the\n"
 "encounter, that the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain\n"
 "from the fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving\n"
 "lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet\n"
 "lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his\n"
 "delirium, that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as\n"
 "he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung to the\n"
 "mad rockings of the gales. And, when running into more sufferable\n"
 "latitudes, the ship, with mild stun'sails spread, floated across the\n"
 "tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man's delirium\n"
 "seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came forth\n"
 "from his dark den into the blessed light and air; even then, when he\n"
 "bore that firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm\n"
 "orders once again; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was\n"
 "now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on. Human madness\n"
 "is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing. When you think it fled,\n"
 "it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler\n"
 "form. Ahab's full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly contracted;\n"
 "like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows narrowly, but\n"
 "unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his narrow-flowing\n"
 "monomania, not one jot of Ahab's broad madness had been left behind;\n"
 "so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural intellect\n"
 "had perished. That before living agent, now became the living\n"
 "instrument. If such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all\n"
 "its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from having\n"
 "lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousand\n"
 "fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one\n"
 "reasonable object.  This is much; yet Ahab's larger, darker, deeper\n"
 "part remains unhinted. But vain to popularize profundities, and all\n"
 "truth is profound. Winding far down from within the very heart of this\n"
 "spiked Hotel de Cluny where we here stand - however grand and\n"
 "wonderful, now quit it; - and take your way, ye nobler, sadder souls,\n"
 "to those vast Roman halls of Thermes; where far beneath the fantastic\n"
 "towers of man's upper earth, his root of grandeur, his whole awful\n"
 "essence sits in bearded state; an antique buried beneath antiquities,\n"
 "and throned on torsoes!  So with a broken throne, the great gods mock\n"
 "that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he patient sits, upholding on\n"
 "his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages. Wind ye down there, ye\n"
 "prouder, sadder souls! question that proud, sad king! A family\n"
 "likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled royalties; and from\n"
 "your grim sire only will the old State-secret come.  Now, in his\n"
 "heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means are sane,\n"
 "my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or change, or\n"
 "shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did now long\n"
 "dissemble; in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling\n"
 "was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will\n"
 "determinate. Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling,\n"
 "that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer\n"
 "thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the\n"
 "quick, with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him.  The report\n"
 "of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to a\n"
 "kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which always\n"
 "afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the pequod on the present\n"
 "voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely, that far\n"
 "from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on account of\n"
 "such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent isle were\n"
 "inclined to\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons he was all\n"
 "the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full of rage\n"
 "and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and scorched\n"
 "without, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea;\n"
 "such an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart his\n"
 "iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes. Or,\n"
 "if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that,\n"
 "yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl\n"
 "on his underlings to the attack. But be all this as it may, certain it\n"
 "is, that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed\n"
 "in him, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one\n"
 "only and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale. Had any one\n"
 "of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking\n"
 "in him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have\n"
 "wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! They were bent on\n"
 "profitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars from the\n"
 "mint. He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural\n"
 "revenge.  Here, then, was this grey- headed, ungodly old man, chasing\n"
 "with curses a Job's whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too,\n"
 "chiefly made up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals -\n"
 "morally enfeebled also, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or\n"
 "right- mindedness in Starbuck, the invulnerable jollity of\n"
 "indifference and recklessness in Stubb, and the pervading mediocrity\n"
 "in Flask. Such a crew, so officered, seemed specially picked and\n"
 "packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac\n"
 "revenge. How it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old\n"
 "man's ire - by what evil magic their souls were possessed, that at\n"
 "times his hate seemed almost theirs; the White Whale as much their\n"
 "insufferable foe as his; how all this came to be - what the White\n"
 "Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious understandings, also,\n"
 "in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have seemed the gliding great\n"
 "demon of the seas of life, - all this to explain, would be to dive\n"
 "deeper than Ishmael can go. The subterranean miner that works in us\n"
 "all, how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting,\n"
 "muffled sound of his pick? Who does not feel the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a seventy-four\n"
 "can stand still? For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment of the\n"
 "time and the place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale,\n"
 "could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " What the White Whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at\n"
 "times, he was to me, as yet remains unsaid.  Aside from those more\n"
 "obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which could not but\n"
 "occasionally awaken in any man's soul some alarm, there was another\n"
 "thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him, which at\n"
 "times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest; and yet so\n"
 "mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost despair of\n"
 "putting it in a comprehensible form. It was the whiteness of the whale\n"
 "that above all things appalled me. But how can I hope to explain\n"
 "myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I must,\n"
 "else all these chapters might be naught.  Though in many natural\n"
 "objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty, as if imparting some\n"
 "special virtue of its own, as in marbles, japonicas, and pearls; and\n"
 "though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal\n"
 "pre-eminence in this hue; even the barbaric, grand old kings of Pegu\n"
 "placing the title \"Lord of the White Elephants\" above all their other\n"
 "magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the modern kings of Siam\n"
 "unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the royal standard; and the\n"
 "Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow-white charger; and\n"
 "the great Austrian Empire, Caesarian, heir to overlording Rome, having\n"
 "for the imperial color the same imperial hue; and though this\n"
 "pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself, giving the white\n"
 "man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe; and though, besides all\n"
 "this, whiteness has been\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " even made significant of gladness, for among the Romans a\n"
 "white stone marked a joyful day; and though in other mortal sympathies\n"
 "and symbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of many touching,\n"
 "noble things - the innocence of brides, the benignity of age; though\n"
 "among the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum\n"
 "was the deepest pledge of honor; though in many climes, whiteness\n"
 "typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and\n"
 "contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by milk-white\n"
 "steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most august\n"
 "religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and\n"
 "power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white forked flame being\n"
 "held the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek mythologies, Great\n"
 "Jove himself made incarnate in a snow-white bull; and though to the\n"
 "noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred White Dog was by\n"
 "far the holiest festival of their theology, that spotless, faithful\n"
 "creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the Great\n"
 "Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity; and though\n"
 "directly from the Latin word for white, all Christian priests derive\n"
 "the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic, worn\n"
 "beneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish\n"
 "faith, white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion\n"
 "of our Lord; though in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given\n"
 "to the redeemed, and the four- and-twenty elders stand clothed in\n"
 "white before the great white throne, and the Holy One that sitteth\n"
 "there white like wool; yet for all these accumulated associations,\n"
 "with whatever is sweet, and honorable, and sublime, there yet lurks an\n"
 "elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue, which strikes\n"
 "more of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood.\n"
 "This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness,\n"
 "when divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any\n"
 "object terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest\n"
 "bounds. Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of\n"
 "the tropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the\n"
 "transcendent horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which\n"
 "imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " more loathsome than terrific, to the dumb gloating of their\n"
 "aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can\n"
 "so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or shark.  Bethink thee\n"
 "of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual wonderment and\n"
 "pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all imaginations? Not\n"
 "Coleridge first threw that spell; but God's great, unflattering\n"
 "laureate, Nature.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is\n"
 "that of the White Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white\n"
 "charger, large-eyed, small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity\n"
 "of a thousand monarchs in his lofty, overscorning carriage. He was the\n"
 "elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those\n"
 "days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies. At\n"
 "their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which\n"
 "every evening leads on the hosts of light. The flashing cascade of his\n"
 "mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings more\n"
 "resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him. A\n"
 "most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western\n"
 "world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the\n"
 "glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god,\n"
 "bluff-bowed and fearless as this mighty steed. Whether marching amid\n"
 "his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly\n"
 "streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether with his\n"
 "circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the White\n"
 "Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through\n"
 "his cool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to\n"
 "the bravest Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and\n"
 "awe. Nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " this noble horse, that it was his spiritual whiteness\n"
 "chiefly, which so clothed him with divineness; and that this\n"
 "divineness had that in it which, though commanding worship, at the\n"
 "same time enforced a certain nameless terror.  But there are other\n"
 "instances where this whiteness loses all that accessory and strange\n"
 "glory which invests it in the White Steed and Albatross.  What is it\n"
 "that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks the eye,\n"
 "as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It is that\n"
 "whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the name he\n"
 "bears. The Albino is as well made as other men - has no substantive\n"
 "deformity - and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes\n"
 "him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion. Why should this\n"
 "be so?  Nor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable\n"
 "but not the less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces\n"
 "this crowning attribute of the terrible. From its snowy aspect, the\n"
 "gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White\n"
 "Squall. Nor, in some historic instances, has the art of human malice\n"
 "omitted so potent an auxiliary. How wildly it heightens the effect of\n"
 "that passage in Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their\n"
 "faction, the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in\n"
 "the market- place!  Nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary\n"
 "experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism\n"
 "of this hue. It cannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality\n"
 "in the aspect of the dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble\n"
 "pallor lingering there; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the\n"
 "badge of consternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation\n"
 "here. And from that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue\n"
 "of the shroud in which we wrap them. Nor even in our superstitions do\n"
 "we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts\n"
 "rising in a milk-white fog - Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us\n"
 "add, that even the king of terrors, when personified by the\n"
 "evangelist, rides on his pallid horse.  Therefore, in his other moods,\n"
 "symbolize whatever grand or\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " gracious thing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in\n"
 "its profoundest idealized significance it calls up a peculiar\n"
 "apparition to the soul.  But though without dissent this point be\n"
 "fixed, how is mortal man to account for it? To analyse it, would seem\n"
 "impossible. Can we, then, by the citation of some of those instances\n"
 "wherein this thing of whiteness - though for the time either wholly or\n"
 "in great part stripped of all direct associations calculated to impart\n"
 "to it aught fearful, but, nevertheless, is found to exert over us the\n"
 "same sorcery, however modified; - can we thus hope to light upon some\n"
 "chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek?  Let us\n"
 "try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety, and\n"
 "without imagination no man can follow another into these halls. And\n"
 "though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions about\n"
 "to be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few perhaps were\n"
 "entirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore may not be able\n"
 "to recall them now.  Why to the man of untutored ideality, who happens\n"
 "to be but loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day,\n"
 "does the bare mention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long,\n"
 "dreary, speechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, downcast and\n"
 "hooded with new-fallen snow? Or, to the unread, unsophisticated\n"
 "Protestant of the Middle American States, why does the passing mention\n"
 "of a White Friar or a White Nun, evoke such an eyeless statue in the\n"
 "soul?  Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned\n"
 "warriors and kings (which will not wholly account for it) that makes\n"
 "the White Tower of London tell so much more strongly on the\n"
 "imagination of an untravelled American, than those other storied\n"
 "structures, its neighbors - the Byward Tower, or even the Bloody?  And\n"
 "those sublimer towers, the White Mountains of New Hampshire, whence,\n"
 "in peculiar moods, comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at\n"
 "the bare mention of that name, while the thought of Virginia's Blue\n"
 "Ridge is full of a soft, dewy, distant dreaminess? Or why,\n"
 "irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes, does the name of the\n"
 "White Sea exert such a spectralness\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " over the fancy, while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with\n"
 "mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves,\n"
 "followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets? Or, to choose a\n"
 "wholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to the fancy, why, in\n"
 "reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe, does \"the tall pale\n"
 "man\" of the Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor unrestingly glides\n"
 "through the green of the groves - why is this phantom more terrible\n"
 "than all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg?  Nor is it, altogether,\n"
 "the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling earthquakes; nor the\n"
 "stampedoes of her frantic seas: nor the tearlessness of arid skies\n"
 "that never rain; nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires,\n"
 "wrenched cope- stones, and crosses all adroop (like canted yards of\n"
 "anchored fleets); and her suburban avenues of house-walls lying over\n"
 "upon each other, as a tossed pack of cards; - it is not these things\n"
 "alone which make tearless Lima, the strangest, saddest city thou\n"
 "can'st see. For Lima has taken the white veil; and there is a higher\n"
 "horror in this whiteness of her woe. Old as Pizarro, this whiteness\n"
 "keeps her ruins for ever new; admits not the cheerful greenness of\n"
 "complete decay; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of\n"
 "an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions.  I know that, to the\n"
 "common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness is not confessed to\n"
 "be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise\n"
 "terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in\n"
 "those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely\n"
 "consists in this one phenomenon, especially when exhibited under any\n"
 "form at all approaching to muteness or universality. What I mean by\n"
 "these two statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the\n"
 "following examples.  First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts\n"
 "of foreign lands, if by night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to\n"
 "vigilance, and feels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his\n"
 "faculties; but under precisely similar circumstances, let him be\n"
 "called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight\n"
 "sea of milky whiteness - as if from encircling headlands shoals of\n"
 "combed white bears were swimming round him, then he feels\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded phantom of the\n"
 "whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost; in vain the lead\n"
 "assures him he is still off soundings; heart and helm they both go\n"
 "down; he never rests till blue water is under him again. Yet where is\n"
 "the mariner who will tell thee, \"Sir, it was not so much the fear of\n"
 "striking hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so\n"
 "stirred me?\"  Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual\n"
 "sight of the snow-howdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except,\n"
 "perhaps, in the mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness\n"
 "reigning at such vast altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a\n"
 "fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman\n"
 "solitudes. Much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the West, who\n"
 "with comparative indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with\n"
 "driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of\n"
 "whiteness. Not so the sailor, beholding the scenery of the Antarctic\n"
 "seas; where at times, by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the\n"
 "powers of frost and air, he, shivering and half shipwrecked, instead\n"
 "of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery, views what seems a\n"
 "boundless church-yard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments\n"
 "and splintered crosses.  But thou sayest, methinks this white-lead\n"
 "chapter about whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven\n"
 "soul; thou surrenderest to a hypo, Ishmael.  Tell me, why this strong\n"
 "young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of Vermont, far removed\n"
 "from all beasts of prey - why is it that upon the sunniest day, if you\n"
 "but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that he cannot even see\n"
 "it, but only smells its wild animal muskiness - why will he start,\n"
 "snort, and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of affright?\n"
 "There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild creatures in his\n"
 "green northern home, so that the strange muskiness he smells cannot\n"
 "recall to him anything associated with the experience of former\n"
 "perils; for what knows he, this New England colt, of the black bisons\n"
 "of distant Oregon?  No: but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute,\n"
 "the instinct of the knowledge of the demonism in the world. Though\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " thousands of miles from Oregon, still when he smells that\n"
 "savage musk, the rending, goring bison herds are as present as to the\n"
 "deserted wild foal of the prairies, which this instant they may be\n"
 "trampling into dust.  Thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea;\n"
 "the bleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of mountains; the desolate\n"
 "shiftings of the windrowed snows of prairies; all these, to Ishmael,\n"
 "are as the shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt!\n"
 "Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic\n"
 "sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt, somewhere\n"
 "those things must exist. Though in many of its aspects this visible\n"
 "world seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were formed in\n"
 "fright.  But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness,\n"
 "and learned why it appeals with such power to the soul; and more\n"
 "strange and far more portentous - why, as we have seen, it is at once\n"
 "the most meaning symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the\n"
 "Christian's Deity; and yet should be as it is, the intensifying agent\n"
 "in things the most appalling to mankind.  Is it that by its\n"
 "indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of\n"
 "the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of\n"
 "annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky way? Or is\n"
 "it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a color as the visible\n"
 "absence of color, and at the same time the concrete of all colors; is\n"
 "it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness, full of\n"
 "meaning, in a wide landscape of snows - a colorless, all- color of\n"
 "atheism from which we shrink? And when we consider that other theory\n"
 "of the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues - every\n"
 "stately or lovely emblazoning - the sweet tinges of sunset skies and\n"
 "woods; yea, and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly\n"
 "cheeks of young girls; all these are but subtile deceits, not actually\n"
 "inherent in substances, but only laid on from without; so that all\n"
 "deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements\n"
 "cover nothing but the charnel-house within; and when we proceed\n"
 "further, and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every\n"
 "one of her hues, the great principle of light, for ever remains white\n"
 "or colorless in itself, and if\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " operating without medium upon matter, would touch all\n"
 "objects, even tulips and roses, with its own blank tinge - pondering\n"
 "all this, the palsied universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful\n"
 "travellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear colored and coloring glasses\n"
 "upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the\n"
 "monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him. And of\n"
 "all these things the Albino Whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at\n"
 "the fiery hunt? With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be\n"
 "urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it\n"
 "is not the whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the\n"
 "intolerable hideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened\n"
 "hideousness, it might be said, only arises from the circumstance, that\n"
 "the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the\n"
 "fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing\n"
 "together two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear\n"
 "frightens us with so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all this\n"
 "to be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have\n"
 "that intensified terror. As for the white shark, the white gliding\n"
 "ghostliness of repose in that creature, when beheld in his ordinary\n"
 "moods, strangely tallies with the same quality in the Polar\n"
 "quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly hit by the French in the\n"
 "name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish mass for the dead begins\n"
 "with Requiem eternam (eternal rest), whence Requiem denominating the\n"
 "mass itself, and any other funereal music. Now, in allusion to the\n"
 "white, silent stillness of death in this shark, and the mild\n"
 "deadliness of his habits, the French call him Requin. I remember the\n"
 "first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged gale, in waters\n"
 "hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch below, I ascended\n"
 "to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the main hatches, I\n"
 "saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and with a hooked,\n"
 "Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its vast archangel\n"
 "wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous flutterings and\n"
 "throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some\n"
 "king's ghost in supernatural distress. Through its inexpressible,\n"
 "strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God. As\n"
 "Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so\n"
 "white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had\n"
 "lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns. Long I\n"
 "gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only hint, the\n"
 "things that darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and turning,\n"
 "asked a sailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney! I never\n"
 "had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious thing\n"
 "is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! But some time after, I\n"
 "learned that goney was some seaman's name for albatross. So that by no\n"
 "possibility could Coleridge's wild Rhyme have had aught to do with\n"
 "those mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon\n"
 "our deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to\n"
 "be an albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish a\n"
 "little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet. I assert,\n"
 "then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks\n"
 "the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in this, that by a\n"
 "solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses; and these I\n"
 "have frequently seen, but never with such emotions as when I beheld\n"
 "the Antarctic fowl. But how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper\n"
 "it not, and I will tell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl\n"
 "floated on the sea. At last the Captain made a postman of it; tying a\n"
 "lettered, leathern tally round its neck, with the ship's time and\n"
 "place; and then letting it escape. But I doubt not, that leathern\n"
 "tally, meant for man, was taken off in Heaven, when the white fowl\n"
 "flew to join the wing-folding, the invoking, and adoring cherubim!\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"Hist! Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?\"  It was the\n"
 "middle-watch; a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in a cordon,\n"
 "extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist, to the\n"
 "scuttle-butt near the taffrail. In this manner, they passed the\n"
 "buckets to fill the scuttle-butt. Standing, for the most part, on the\n"
 "hallowed precincts of the quarter-deck, they were careful not to speak\n"
 "or rustle their feet. From hand to hand, the buckets went in the\n"
 "deepest silence, only broken by the occasional flap of a sail, and the\n"
 "steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel.  It was in the midst of\n"
 "this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon, whose post was near the\n"
 "after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a Cholo, the words above.\n"
 "\n"
 "\"Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?\"  \"Take the bucket, will ye,\n"
 "Archy? what noise d'ye mean?\"  \"There it is again - under the hatches\n"
 "- don't you hear it - a cough - it sounded like a cough.\"  \"Cough be\n"
 "damned! Pass along that return bucket.\"  \"There again - there it is! -\n"
 "it sounds like two or three sleepers turning over, now!\"  \"Caramba!\n"
 "have done, shipmate, will ye? It's the three soaked biscuits ye eat\n"
 "for supper turning over inside of ye - nothing else. Look to the\n"
 "bucket!\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"Say what ye will, shipmate; I've sharp ears.\"  \"Aye, you are\n"
 "the chap, ain't ye, that heard the hum of the old Quakeress's\n"
 "knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket; you're the chap.\"\n"
 "\"Grin away; we'll see what turns up. Hark ye, Cabaco, there is\n"
 "somebody down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck;\n"
 "and I suspect our old Mogul knows something of it too. I heard Stubb\n"
 "tell Flask, one morning watch, that there was something of that sort\n"
 "in the wind.\"  \"Tish! the bucket!\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the\n"
 "squall that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification\n"
 "of his purpose with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker\n"
 "in the transom, and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish\n"
 "sea charts, spread them before him on his screwed-down table. Then\n"
 "seating himself before it, you would have seen him intently study the\n"
 "various lines and shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but\n"
 "steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were\n"
 "blank. At intervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books beside\n"
 "him, wherein were set down the seasons and places in which, on various\n"
 "former voyages of various ships, Sperm Whales had been captured or\n"
 "seen.  While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains\n"
 "over his head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for\n"
 "ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled\n"
 "brow, till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out\n"
 "lines and courses on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was\n"
 "also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his\n"
 "forehead.  But it was not this night in particular that, in the\n"
 "solitude of\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " his cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every\n"
 "night they were brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were\n"
 "effaced, and others were substituted. For with the charts of all four\n"
 "oceans before him, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies,\n"
 "with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac\n"
 "thought of his soul.  Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the\n"
 "ways of the leviathans, it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus\n"
 "to seek out one solitary creature in the unhooped oceans of this\n"
 "planet. But not so did it seem to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides\n"
 "and currents; and thereby calculating the driftings of the Sperm\n"
 "Whale's food; and, also, calling to mind the regular, ascertained\n"
 "seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes; could arrive at\n"
 "reasonable surmises, almost approaching to certainties, concerning the\n"
 "timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of his prey.\n"
 "So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the\n"
 "Sperm Whale's resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe\n"
 "that, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world;\n"
 "were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully\n"
 "collated, then the migrations of the Sperm Whale would be found to\n"
 "correspond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the\n"
 "flights of swallows. On this hint, attempts have been made to\n"
 "construct elaborate migratory charts of the Sperm Whale.  Besides,\n"
 "when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the Sperm\n"
 "Whales, guided by some infallible instinct - say, rather, secret\n"
 "intelligence from the Deity - mostly swim in\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " veins, as they are called; continuing their way along a given\n"
 "ocean-line with such undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed\n"
 "her course, by any chart, with one tithe of such marvellous\n"
 "precision. Though, in these cases, the direction taken by any one\n"
 "whale be straight as a surveyor's parallel, and though the line of\n"
 "advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable, straight wake,\n"
 "yet the arbitrary vein in which at these times he is said to swim,\n"
 "generally embraces some few miles in width (more or less, as the vein\n"
 "is presumed to expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual sweep\n"
 "from the whale- ship's mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along\n"
 "this magic zone. The sum is, that at particular seasons within that\n"
 "breadth and along that path, migrating whales may with great\n"
 "confidence be looked for.  And hence not only at substantiated times,\n"
 "upon well known separate feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter\n"
 "his prey; but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those\n"
 "grounds he could, by his art, so place and time himself on his way, as\n"
 "even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting.  There was a\n"
 "circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious but\n"
 "still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality, perhaps. Though\n"
 "the gregarious Sperm Whales have their regular seasons for particular\n"
 "grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds which\n"
 "hunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year, say, will turn\n"
 "out to be identically the same with those that were found there the\n"
 "preceding season; though there are peculiar and unquestionable\n"
 "instances where the contrary of this has proved true. In general, the\n"
 "same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the solitaries\n"
 "and hermits among the matured, aged Sperm Whales. So that though Moby\n"
 "Dick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what is called\n"
 "the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on the\n"
 "Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that were the pequod to visit\n"
 "either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she\n"
 "would infallibly encounter him there. So, too, with some other feeding\n"
 "grounds, where he had at times revealed himself.  But all these seemed\n"
 "only his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to speak, not his\n"
 "places of prolonged abode. And where Ahab's chances of accomplishing\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " his object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only\n"
 "been made to whatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his,\n"
 "ere a particular set time or place were attained, when all\n"
 "possibilities would become probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought,\n"
 "every possibility the next thing to a certainty. That particular set\n"
 "time and place were conjoined in the one technical phrase - the\n"
 "Season-on-the-Line. For there and then, for several consecutive years,\n"
 "Moby Dick had been periodically descried, lingering in those waters\n"
 "for awhile, as the sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted\n"
 "interval in any one sign of the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most\n"
 "of the deadly encounters with the White Whale had taken place; there\n"
 "the waves were storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot\n"
 "where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his\n"
 "vengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering\n"
 "vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this\n"
 "unfaltering hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes\n"
 "upon the one crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it\n"
 "might be to those hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he\n"
 "so tranquillize his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening\n"
 "quest.  Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very\n"
 "beginning of the Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could\n"
 "enable her commander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape\n"
 "Horn, and then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the\n"
 "equatorial Pacific in time to cruise there.  Therefore, he must wait\n"
 "for the next ensuing season. Yet the premature hour of the Pequod's\n"
 "sailing had, perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to\n"
 "this very complexion of things. Because, an interval of three hundred\n"
 "and sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which,\n"
 "instead of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a\n"
 "miscellaneous hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his\n"
 "vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding-grounds,\n"
 "should turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the\n"
 "Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his\n"
 "race. So that Monsoons, Pampas, Nor-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any\n"
 "wind but the Levanter and Simoom, might blow Moby Dick into\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the devious zig-zag world-circle of the Pequod's\n"
 "circumnavigating wake.  But granting all this; yet, regarded\n"
 "discreetly and coolly, seems it not but a mad idea, this; that in the\n"
 "broad boundless ocean, one solitary whale, even if encountered, should\n"
 "be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter, even as\n"
 "a white-bearded Mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople?\n"
 "Yes. For the peculiar snow- white brow of Moby Dick, and his\n"
 "snow-white hump, could not but be unmistakable. And have I not tallied\n"
 "the whale, Ahab would mutter to himself, as after poring over his\n"
 "charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in\n"
 "reveries - tallied him, and shall he escape? His broad fins are bored,\n"
 "and scalloped out like a lost sheep's ear!  And here, his mad mind\n"
 "would run on in a breathless race; till a weariness and faintness of\n"
 "pondering came over him; and in the open air of the deck he would seek\n"
 "to recover his strength. Ah, God! what trances of torments does that\n"
 "man endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire. He\n"
 "sleeps with clenched hands; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his\n"
 "palms.  Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and\n"
 "intolerably vivid dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense\n"
 "thoughts through the day, carried them on amid a clashing of\n"
 "phrensies, and whirled them round and round in his blazing brain, till\n"
 "the very throbbing of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and\n"
 "when, as was sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved\n"
 "his being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from\n"
 "which forked flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends\n"
 "beckoned him to leap down among them; when this hell in himself yawned\n"
 "beneath him, a wild cry would be heard through the ship; and with\n"
 "glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room, as though escaping\n"
 "from a bed that was on fire. Yet these, perhaps, instead of being the\n"
 "unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright at his own\n"
 "resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity. For, at such\n"
 "times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the\n"
 "White Whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock, was not the agent\n"
 "that so caused\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " him to burst from it in horror again. The latter was the\n"
 "eternal, living principle or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the\n"
 "time dissociated from the characterizing mind, which at other times\n"
 "employed it for its outer vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought\n"
 "escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing, of which,\n"
 "for the time, it was no longer an integral. But as the mind does not\n"
 "exist unless leagued with the soul, therefore it must have been that,\n"
 "in Ahab's case, yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one\n"
 "supreme purpose; that purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will,\n"
 "forced itself against gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed,\n"
 "independent being of its own. Nay, could grimly live and burn, while\n"
 "the common vitality to which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken\n"
 "from the unbidden and unfathered birth.  Therefore, the tormented\n"
 "spirit that glared out of bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab rushed\n"
 "from his room, was for the time but a vacated thing, a formless\n"
 "somnambulistic being, a ray of living light, to be sure, but without\n"
 "an object to color, and therefore a blankness in itself. God help\n"
 "thee, old man, thy thoughts have created a creature in thee; and he\n"
 "whose intense thinking thus makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds\n"
 "upon that heart for ever; that vulture the very creature he\n"
 "creates. Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne\n"
 "out by an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the\n"
 "National Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By that circular,\n"
 "it appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and\n"
 "portions of it are presented in the circular. \"This chart divides the\n"
 "ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of\n"
 "longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve\n"
 "columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each of which\n"
 "districts are three lines; one to show the number of days that have\n"
 "been spent in each month in every district, and the two others to show\n"
 "the number of days in which whales, sperm or right, have been seen.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and,\n"
 "indeed, as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious\n"
 "particulars in the habits of Sperm Whales, the foregoing chapter, in\n"
 "its earliest part, is as important a one as will be found in this\n"
 "volume; but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and\n"
 "more familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be adequately understood,\n"
 "and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance\n"
 "of the entire subject may\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " induce in some minds, as to the natural verity of the main\n"
 "points of this affair.  I care not to perform this part of my task\n"
 "methodically; but shall be content to produce the desired impression\n"
 "by separate citations of items, practically or reliably known to me as\n"
 "a whaleman; and from these citations, I take it - the conclusion aimed\n"
 "at will naturally follow of itself.  First: I have personally known\n"
 "three instances where a whale, after receiving a harpoon, has effected\n"
 "a complete escape; and, after an interval (in one instance of three\n"
 "years), has been again struck by the same hand, and slain; when the\n"
 "two irons, both marked by the same private cypher, have been taken\n"
 "from the body. In the instance where three years intervened between\n"
 "the flinging of the two harpoons; and I think it may have been\n"
 "something more than that; the man who darted them happening, in the\n"
 "interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa, went ashore\n"
 "there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far into the interior,\n"
 "where he travelled for a period of nearly two years, often endangered\n"
 "by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other\n"
 "common perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown\n"
 "regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have been on its\n"
 "travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe, brushing\n"
 "with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no purpose. This man\n"
 "and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the\n"
 "other. I say I, myself, have known three instances similar to this;\n"
 "that is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and, upon the second\n"
 "attack, saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them,\n"
 "afterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so\n"
 "fell out that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the\n"
 "last time distinctly recognized a peculiar sort of huge mole under the\n"
 "whale's eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I say\n"
 "three years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are\n"
 "three instances, then, which I personally know the truth of; but I\n"
 "have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the\n"
 "matter there is no good ground to impeach.  Secondly: It is well known\n"
 "in the Sperm Whale Fishery,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " however ignorant the world ashore may be of it, that there\n"
 "have been several memorable historical instances where a particular\n"
 "whale in the ocean has been at distant times and places popularly\n"
 "cognisable. Why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and\n"
 "originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from\n"
 "other whales; for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale\n"
 "may be, they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him, and\n"
 "boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil. No: the reason was\n"
 "this: that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a\n"
 "terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did\n"
 "about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most fishermen were content to\n"
 "recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be\n"
 "discovered lounging by them on the sea, without seeking to cultivate a\n"
 "more intimate acquaintance. Like some poor devils ashore that happen\n"
 "to know an irascible great man, they make distant unobtrusive\n"
 "salutations to him in the street, lest if they pursued the\n"
 "acquaintance further, they might receive a summary thump for their\n"
 "presumption.  But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great\n"
 "individual celebrity - nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not\n"
 "only was he famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories\n"
 "after death, but he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and\n"
 "distinctions of a name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or\n"
 "Caesar. Was it not so, O Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like\n"
 "an iceberg, who so long did'st lurk in the Oriental straits of that\n"
 "name, whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay? Was it\n"
 "not so, O New Zealand Jack! thou terror of all cruisers that crossed\n"
 "their wakes in the vicinity of the Tattoo Land? Was it not so, O\n"
 "Morquan! King of Japan, whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the\n"
 "semblance of a snow-white cross against the sky? Was it not so, O Don\n"
 "Miguel! thou Chilian whale, marked like an old tortoise with mystic\n"
 "hieroglyphics upon the back! In plain prose, here are four whales as\n"
 "well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla to\n"
 "the classic scholar.  But this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don\n"
 "Miguel, after at various times creating great havoc among the boats of\n"
 "different\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " vessels, were finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted\n"
 "out, chased and killed by valiant whaling captains, who heaved up\n"
 "their anchors with that express object as much in view, as in setting\n"
 "out through the Narragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it in\n"
 "his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage Annawon, the\n"
 "headmost warrior of the Indian King Philip.  I do not know where I can\n"
 "find a better place than just here, to make mention of one or two\n"
 "other things, which to me seem important, as in printed form\n"
 "establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of\n"
 "the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe. For this is one of\n"
 "those disheartening instances where truth requires full as much\n"
 "bolstering as error. So ignorant are most landsmen of some of the\n"
 "plainest and most palpable wonders of the world, that without some\n"
 "hints touching the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the\n"
 "fishery, they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still\n"
 "worse and more detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.  First:\n"
 "Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general perils\n"
 "of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid\n"
 "conception of those perils, and the frequency with which they\n"
 "recur. One reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual\n"
 "disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public\n"
 "record at home, however transient and immediately forgotten that\n"
 "record. Do you suppose that that poor fellow there, who this moment\n"
 "perhaps caught by the whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being\n"
 "carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan - do\n"
 "you suppose that that poor fellow's name will appear in the newspaper\n"
 "obituary you will read to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the\n"
 "mails are very irregular between here and New Guinea. In fact, did you\n"
 "ever hear what might be called regular news direct or indirect from\n"
 "New Guinea? Yet I tell you that upon one particular voyage which I\n"
 "made to the Pacific, among many others we spoke thirty different\n"
 "ships, every one of which had had a death by a whale, some of them\n"
 "more than one, and three that had each lost a boat's crew. For God's\n"
 "sake, be economical with your lamps and candles! not a gallon you\n"
 "burn, but at least one drop of man's blood was spilled for it.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that\n"
 "a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever\n"
 "found that when narrating to them some specific example of this\n"
 "two-fold enormousness, they have significantly complimented me upon my\n"
 "facetiousness; when, I declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of\n"
 "being facetious than Moses, when he wrote the history of the plagues\n"
 "of Egypt.  But fortunately the special point I here seek can be\n"
 "established upon testimony entirely independent of my own. That point\n"
 "is this: The Sperm Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful,\n"
 "knowing, and judiciously malicious, as with direct aforethought to\n"
 "stave in, utterly destroy, and sink a large ship; and what is more,\n"
 "the Sperm Whale has done it.  First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex,\n"
 "Captain Pollard, of Nantucket, was cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One\n"
 "day she saw spouts, lowered her boats, and gave chase to a shoal of\n"
 "Sperm Whales. Ere long, several of the whales were wounded; when,\n"
 "suddenly, a very large whale escaping from the boats, issued from the\n"
 "shoal, and bore directly down upon the ship. dashing his forehead\n"
 "against her hull, he so stove her in, that in less than \"ten minutes\"\n"
 "she settled down and fell over. Not a surviving plank of her has been\n"
 "seen since. After the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the\n"
 "land in their boats. Being returned home at last, Captain Pollard once\n"
 "more sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship, but the gods\n"
 "shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers; for the second\n"
 "time his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he\n"
 "has never tempted it since. At this day Captain Pollard is a resident\n"
 "of Nantucket. I have seen Owen Chace, who was chief mate of the Essex\n"
 "at the time of the tragedy; I have read his plain and faithful\n"
 "narrative; I have conversed with his son; and all this within a few\n"
 "miles of the scene of the catastrophe.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Secondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year\n"
 "1807 totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic\n"
 "particulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter,\n"
 "though from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual\n"
 "allusions to it.  Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore\n"
 "J - then commanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class,\n"
 "happened to be dining with a party of whaling captains, on board a\n"
 "Nantucket ship in the harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation\n"
 "turning upon whales, the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical\n"
 "touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional\n"
 "gentlemen present. He peremptorily denied for example, that any whale\n"
 "could so smite his stout sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much\n"
 "as a thimbleful.  Very good; but there is more coming. Some weeks\n"
 "after, the commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for\n"
 "Valparaiso. But he was stopped on the way by a portly Sperm Whale,\n"
 "that begged a few moments' confidential business with him. that\n"
 "business consisted in fetching the Commodore's craft\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " such a thwack, that with all his pumps going he made straight\n"
 "for the nearest port to heave down and repair. I am not superstitious,\n"
 "but I consider the Commodore's interview with that whale as\n"
 "providential. Was not Saul of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a\n"
 "similar fright? I tell you, the Sperm Whale will stand no nonsense.  I\n"
 "will now refer you to Langsdorff's Voyages for a little circumstance\n"
 "in point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof. Langsdorff, you\n"
 "must know by the way, was attached to the Russian Admiral\n"
 "Krusenstern's famous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the\n"
 "present century. Captain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth\n"
 "chapter.  \"By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and\n"
 "the next day we were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The\n"
 "weather was very clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were\n"
 "obliged to keep on our fur clothing. For some days we had very little\n"
 "wind; it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the\n"
 "northwest sprang up. An uncommon large whale, the body of which was\n"
 "larger than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the water,\n"
 "but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the\n"
 "ship, which was in full sail, was almost upon him, so that it was\n"
 "impossible to prevent its striking against him. We were thus placed in\n"
 "the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature, setting up its\n"
 "back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water. The masts\n"
 "reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below all\n"
 "sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck upon\n"
 "some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the\n"
 "utmost gravity and solemnity. Captain D'Wolf applied immediately to\n"
 "the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage\n"
 "from the shock, but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely\n"
 "uninjured.\"  Now, the Captain D'Wolf here alluded to as commanding the\n"
 "ship in question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of\n"
 "unusual adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village\n"
 "of Dorchester near Boston. I have the honor of being a nephew of\n"
 "his. I have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in\n"
 "Langsdorff. He substantiates every word.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " The ship, however, was by no means a large one: a Russian\n"
 "craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my uncle after\n"
 "bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.  In that up\n"
 "and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full, too, of\n"
 "honest wonders - the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient Dampier's\n"
 "old chums - I found a little matter set down so like that just quoted\n"
 "from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a\n"
 "corroborative example, if such be needed.  Lionel, it seems, was on\n"
 "his way to \"John Ferdinando,\" as he calls the modern Juan\n"
 "Fernandes. \"In our way thither,\" he says, \"about four o'clock in the\n"
 "morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the\n"
 "Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock, which put our men in\n"
 "such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what\n"
 "to think; but every one began to prepare for death. And, indeed, the\n"
 "shock was so sudden and violent, that we took it for granted the ship\n"
 "had struck against a rock; but when the amazement was a little over,\n"
 "we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no ground.  several of the\n"
 "men were shaken out of their hammocks. Captain Davis, who lay with his\n"
 "head on a gun, was thrown out of his cabin!\" Lionel then goes on to\n"
 "impute the shock to an earthquake, and seems to substantiate the\n"
 "imputation by stating that a great earthquake, somewhere about that\n"
 "time, did actually do great mischief along the spanish land. but i\n"
 "should not much wonder if, in the darkness of that early hour of the\n"
 "morning, the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically\n"
 "bumping the hull from beneath.  I might proceed with several more\n"
 "examples, one way or another known to me, of the great power and\n"
 "malice at times of the Sperm Whale. In more than one instance, he has\n"
 "been known, not only to chase the assailing boats back to their ships,\n"
 "but to pursue the ship itself, and long withstand all the lances\n"
 "hurled at him from its decks. The English ship Pusie Hall can tell a\n"
 "story on that head; and, as for his strength, let me say, that there\n"
 "have been examples where the lines attached to\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " a running Sperm Whale have, in a calm, been transferred to\n"
 "the ship, and secured there; the whale towing her great hull through\n"
 "the water, as a horse walks off with a cart. Again, it is very often\n"
 "observed that, if the Sperm Whale, once struck, is allowed time to\n"
 "rally, he then acts, not so often with blind rage, as with wilful,\n"
 "deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers; nor is it without\n"
 "conveying some eloquent indication of his character, that upon being\n"
 "attacked he will frequently open his mouth, and retain it in that\n"
 "dread expansion for several consecutive minutes. But I must be content\n"
 "with only one more and a concluding illustration; a remarkable and\n"
 "most significant one, by which you will not fail to see, that not only\n"
 "is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain facts\n"
 "of the present day, but that these marvels (like all marvels) are mere\n"
 "repetitions of the ages; so that for the millionth time we say amen\n"
 "with Solomon - Verily there is nothing new under the sun.  In the\n"
 "sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate of\n"
 "Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius\n"
 "general.  As many know, he wrote the history of his own times, a work\n"
 "every way of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he has always\n"
 "been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian,\n"
 "except in some one or two particulars, not at all affecting the matter\n"
 "presently to be mentioned.  Now, in this history of his, Procopius\n"
 "mentions that, during the term of his prefecture at Constantinople, a\n"
 "great sea-monster was captured in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of\n"
 "Marmora, after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters\n"
 "for a period of more than fifty years. A fact thus set down in\n"
 "substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid. Nor is there any reason\n"
 "it should be. Of what precise species this sea- monster was, is not\n"
 "mentioned.  But as he destroyed ships, as well as for other reasons,\n"
 "he must have been a whale; and I am strongly inclined to think a Sperm\n"
 "Whale. And I will tell you why. For a long time I fancied that the\n"
 "Sperm Whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep\n"
 "waters connecting with it. Even now I am certain that those seas are\n"
 "not, and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " things, a place for his habitual gregarious resort. But\n"
 "further investigations have recently proved to me, that in modern\n"
 "times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the Sperm\n"
 "Whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, on good authority, that on the\n"
 "Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the\n"
 "skeleton of a Sperm Whale. Now, as a vessel of war readily passes\n"
 "through the Dardanelles, hence a Sperm Whale could, by the same route,\n"
 "pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.  In the Propontis,\n"
 "as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar substance called brit is\n"
 "to be found, the aliment of the Right Whale. But I have every reason\n"
 "to believe that the food of the Sperm Whale - squid or cuttle-fish -\n"
 "lurks at the bottom of that sea, because large creatures, but by no\n"
 "means the largest of that sort, have been found at its surface. If,\n"
 "then, you properly put these statements together, and reason upon them\n"
 "a bit, you will clearly perceive that, according to all human\n"
 "reasoning, Procopius's sea-monster, that for half a century stove the\n"
 "ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all probability have been a Sperm\n"
 "Whale. The following are extracts from Chace's narrative: \"Every fact\n"
 "seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance\n"
 "which directed his operations; he made two several attacks upon the\n"
 "ship, at a short interval between them, both of which, according to\n"
 "their direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being\n"
 "made ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the\n"
 "shock; to effect which, the exact manoeuvres which he made were\n"
 "necessary. His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated\n"
 "resentment and fury. He came directly from the shoal which we had just\n"
 "before entered, and in which we had struck three of his companions, as\n"
 "if fired with revenge for their sufferings.\" Again: \"At all events,\n"
 "the whole circumstances taken together, all happening before my own\n"
 "eyes, and producing, at the time, impressions in my mind of decided,\n"
 "calculating mischief, on the part of the whale (many of which\n"
 "impressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied that I am\n"
 "correct in my opinion.\" Here are his reflections some time after\n"
 "quitting the ship, during a black night in an open boat, when almost\n"
 "despairing of reaching any hospitable shore. \"The dark ocean and\n"
 "swelling waters were nothing; the fears of being swallowed up by some\n"
 "dreadful tempest, or dashed upon hidden rocks, with all the other\n"
 "ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation, seemed scarcely entitled\n"
 "to a moment's thought; the dismal looking wreck, and the horrid aspect\n"
 "and revenge of the whale, wholly engrossed my reflections, until day\n"
 "again made its appearance.\" In another place - p. 45, - he speaks of\n"
 "the mysterious and mortal attack of the animal.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in\n"
 "all his thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of\n"
 "Moby Dick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to\n"
 "that one passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature\n"
 "and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman's ways,\n"
 "altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage.  Or at\n"
 "least if this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives\n"
 "much more influential with him. It would be refining too much,\n"
 "perhaps, even considering his monomania, to hint that his\n"
 "vindictiveness towards\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some\n"
 "degree to all Sperm Whales, and that the more monsters he slew by so\n"
 "much the more he multiplied the chances that each subsequently\n"
 "encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted. But if\n"
 "such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, there were still\n"
 "additional considerations which, though not so strictly according with\n"
 "the wildness of his ruling passion, yet were by no means incapable of\n"
 "swaying him.  To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all\n"
 "tools used in the shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of\n"
 "order. He knew, for example, that however magnetic his ascendency in\n"
 "some respects was over Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the\n"
 "complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority\n"
 "involves intellectual mastership; for to the purely spiritual, the\n"
 "intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation.  Starbuck's\n"
 "body and Starbuck's coerced will were Ahab's, so long as Ahab kept his\n"
 "magnet at Starbuck's brain; still he knew that for all this the chief\n"
 "mate, in his soul, abhorred his captain's quest, and could he, would\n"
 "joyfully disintegrate himself from it, or even frustrate it. it might\n"
 "be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was\n"
 "seen. During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall\n"
 "into open relapses of rebellion against his captain's leadership,\n"
 "unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were\n"
 "brought to bear upon him. Not only that, but the subtle insanity of\n"
 "Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested\n"
 "than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that, for\n"
 "the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange\n"
 "imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the full\n"
 "terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure\n"
 "background (for few men's courage is proof against protracted\n"
 "meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long\n"
 "night watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to\n"
 "think of than Moby Dick. For however eagerly and impetuously the\n"
 "savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors\n"
 "of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable - they live in\n"
 "the varying outer weather, and they inhale its fickleness - and when\n"
 "retained\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " for any object remote and blank in the pursuit, however\n"
 "promissory of life and passion in the end, it is above all things\n"
 "requisite that temporary interests and employment should intervene and\n"
 "hold them healthily suspended for the final dash.  Nor was Ahab\n"
 "unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion mankind disdain\n"
 "all base considerations; but such times are evanescent. The permanent\n"
 "constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought Ahab, is\n"
 "sordidness.  Granting that the White Whale fully incites the hearts of\n"
 "this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even breeds a\n"
 "certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for the love\n"
 "of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food for their\n"
 "more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and chivalric\n"
 "Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles\n"
 "of land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without committing\n"
 "burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by\n"
 "the way. Had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic\n"
 "object - that final and romantic object, too many would have turned\n"
 "from in disgust. I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of all\n"
 "hopes of cash - aye, cash. They may scorn cash now; but let some\n"
 "months go by, and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this\n"
 "same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash\n"
 "would soon cashier Ahab.  Nor was there wanting still another\n"
 "precautionary motive more related to Ahab personally. Having\n"
 "impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed\n"
 "the prime but private purpose of the Pequod's voyage, Ahab was now\n"
 "entirely conscious that, in so doing, he had indirectly laid himself\n"
 "open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation; and with perfect\n"
 "impunity, both moral and legal, his crew if so disposed, and to that\n"
 "end competent, could refuse all further obedience to him, and even\n"
 "violently wrest from him the command. From even the barely hinted\n"
 "imputation of usurpation, and the possible consequences of such a\n"
 "suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab must of course have been\n"
 "most anxious to protect himself. That protection could only consist in\n"
 "his own predominating brain and heart and hand, backed by a heedful,\n"
 "closely calculating\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " attention to every minute atmospheric influence which it was\n"
 "possible for his crew to be subjected to.  For all these reasons then,\n"
 "and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally developed here, Ahab\n"
 "plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue true to the\n"
 "natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod's voyage; observe all customary\n"
 "usages; and not only that, but force himself to evince all his well\n"
 "known passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession.\n"
 "Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three\n"
 "mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not\n"
 "omit reporting even a porpoise. This vigilance was not long without\n"
 "reward.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " It was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily\n"
 "lounging about the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the\n"
 "lead-colored waters. Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what\n"
 "is called a sword-mat, for an additional lashing to our boat. So still\n"
 "and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene, and such an\n"
 "incantation of revery lurked in the air, that each silent sailor\n"
 "seemed resolved into his own invisible self.  I was the attendant or\n"
 "page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat. As I kept passing and\n"
 "repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long yarns of the\n"
 "warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as Queequeg, standing\n"
 "sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the\n"
 "threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly and\n"
 "unthinkingly drove home every yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess did\n"
 "there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea, only broken\n"
 "by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as if this\n"
 "were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle mechanically\n"
 "weaving and weaving away at the Fates. There lay the fixed\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " threads of the warp subject to but one single, ever\n"
 "returning, unchanging vibration, and that vibration merely enough to\n"
 "admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its\n"
 "own. This warp seemed necessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand\n"
 "I ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable\n"
 "threads. Meantime, Queequeg's impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes\n"
 "hitting the woof slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as\n"
 "the case might be; and by this difference in the concluding blow\n"
 "producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the\n"
 "completed fabric; this savage's sword, thought I, which thus finally\n"
 "shapes and fashions both warp and woof; this easy, indifferent sword\n"
 "must be chance - aye, chance, free will, and necessity - no wise\n"
 "incompatible - all interweavingly working together. The straight warp\n"
 "of necessity, not to be swerved from its ultimate course - its every\n"
 "alternating vibration, indeed, only tending to that; free will still\n"
 "free to ply her shuttle between given threads; and chance, though\n"
 "restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity, and\n"
 "sideways in its motions directed by free will, though thus prescribed\n"
 "to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the last featuring\n"
 "blow at events.  Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started\n"
 "at a sound so strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly,\n"
 "that the ball of free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up\n"
 "at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing. High aloft in the\n"
 "cross-trees was that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching\n"
 "eagerly forward, his hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief\n"
 "sudden intervals he continued his cries. To be sure the same sound was\n"
 "that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds\n"
 "of whalemen's look-outs perched as high in the air; but from few of\n"
 "those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a\n"
 "marvellous cadence as from Tashtego the Indian's.  As he stood\n"
 "hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and eagerly peering\n"
 "towards the horizon, you would have thought him some prophet or seer\n"
 "beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries announcing\n"
 "their coming.  \"There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she\n"
 "blows!\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"Where-away?\"  \"On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a\n"
 "school of them!\"  Instantly all was commotion.  The Sperm Whale blows\n"
 "as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and reliable\n"
 "uniformity. And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other\n"
 "tribes of his genus.  \"There go flukes!\" was now the cry from\n"
 "Tashtego; and the whales disappeared.  \"Quick, steward!\" cried\n"
 "Ahab. \"Time! time!\"  Dough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch,\n"
 "and reported the exact minute to Ahab.  The ship was now kept away\n"
 "from the wind, and she went gently rolling before it.  Tashtego\n"
 "reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward, we\n"
 "confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our\n"
 "bows. For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale\n"
 "when, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while\n"
 "concealed beneath the surface, mills round, and swiftly swims off in\n"
 "the opposite quarter - this deceitfulness of his could not now be in\n"
 "action; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by\n"
 "Tashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our\n"
 "vicinity. One of the men selected for shipkeepers - that is, those not\n"
 "appointed to the boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the\n"
 "main-mast head. The sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down; the\n"
 "line tubs were fixed in their places; the cranes were thrust out; the\n"
 "mainyard was backed, and the three boats swung over the sea like three\n"
 "samphire baskets over high cliffs. Outside of the bulwarks their eager\n"
 "crews with one hand clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly\n"
 "poised on the gunwale. So look the long line of man-of-war's men about\n"
 "to throw themselves on board an enemy's ship.  But at this critical\n"
 "instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the\n"
 "whale. With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who was surrounded by\n"
 "five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the\n"
 "other side of the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting\n"
 "loose the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there. This boat\n"
 "had always been deemed one of the spare boats, though technically\n"
 "called the captain's, on account of its hanging from the starboard\n"
 "quarter. The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart,\n"
 "with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips. A\n"
 "rumpled Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with\n"
 "wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff. But strangely crowning his\n"
 "ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban, the living hair\n"
 "braided and coiled round and round upon his head. Less swart in\n"
 "aspect, the companions of this figure were of that vivid, tiger-yellow\n"
 "complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the Manillas;\n"
 "- a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty, and by some\n"
 "honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret\n"
 "confidential agents on the water of the devil, their lord, whose\n"
 "counting-room they suppose to be elsewhere.  While yet the wondering\n"
 "ship's company were gazing upon these strangers, Ahab cried out to the\n"
 "white-turbaned old man at their head, \"All ready there, Fedallah?\"\n"
 "\"Ready,\" was the half-hissed reply.  \"Lower away then; d'ye hear?\"\n"
 "shouting across the deck. \"Lower away there, I say.\"  Such was the\n"
 "thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the men sprang\n"
 "over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with a wallow,\n"
 "the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a dexterous,\n"
 "off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the sailors,\n"
 "goat-like, leaped down the rolling ship's side into the tossed boats\n"
 "below.  Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship's lee, when\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " a fourth keel, coming from the windward side, pulled round\n"
 "under the stern, and showed the five strangers rowing Ahab, who,\n"
 "standing erect in the stern, loudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask,\n"
 "to spread themselves widely, so as to cover a large expanse of\n"
 "water. but with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah\n"
 "and his crew, the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command.\n"
 "\"Captain Ahab? - \" said Starbuck.  \"Spread yourselves,\" cried Ahab;\n"
 "\"give way, all four boats. Thou, Flask, pull out more to leeward!\"\n"
 "\"Aye, aye, sir,\" cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his\n"
 "great steering oar. \"Lay back!\" addressing his crew. \"There! - there!\n"
 "- there again!  There she blows right ahead, boys! - lay back!\"\n"
 "\"Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.\"  \"Oh, I don't mind 'em, sir,\"\n"
 "said Archy; \"I knew it all before now. Didn't I hear 'em in the hold?\n"
 "And didn't I tell Cabaco here of it? What say ye, Cabaco?  They are\n"
 "stowaways, Mr. Flask.\"  \"Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my\n"
 "children; pull, my little ones,\" drawingly and soothingly sighed Stubb\n"
 "to his crew, some of whom still showed signs of uneasiness. \"Why don't\n"
 "you break your backbones, my boys? What is it you stare at? Those\n"
 "chaps in yonder boat? Tut! They are only five more hands come to help\n"
 "us - never mind from where - the more the merrier. Pull, then, do\n"
 "pull; never mind the brimstone - devils are good fellows enough. So,\n"
 "so; there you are now; that's the stroke for a thousand pounds; that's\n"
 "the stroke to sweep the stakes! Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil,\n"
 "my heroes! Three cheers, men - all hearts alive! Easy, easy; don't be\n"
 "in a hurry - don't be in a hurry. Why don't you snap your oars, you\n"
 "rascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so, so, then; - softly, softly!\n"
 "That's it - that's it! long and strong. Give way there, give way! The\n"
 "devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are all asleep.  Stop\n"
 "snoring, ye sleepers, and pull. Pull, will ye? pull, can't ye? pull,\n"
 "won't ye? Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes don't ye pull?\n"
 "- pull and break something! pull, and start your\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " eyes out! Here! whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle;\n"
 "every mother's son of ye draw his knife, and pull with the blade\n"
 "between his teeth. That's it - that's it. Now ye do something; that\n"
 "looks like it, my steel-bits. Start her - start her, my silver-spoons!\n"
 "Start her, marling-spikes!\"  Stubb's exordium to his crew is given\n"
 "here at large, because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them\n"
 "in general, and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing. But\n"
 "you must not suppose from this specimen of his sermonizings that he\n"
 "ever flew into downright passions with his congregation.  Not at all;\n"
 "and therein consisted his chief peculiarity. He would say the most\n"
 "terrific things to his crew, in a tone so strangely compounded of fun\n"
 "and fury, and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the\n"
 "fun, that no oarsman could hear such queer invocations without pulling\n"
 "for dear life, and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing. Besides\n"
 "he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself, so loungingly\n"
 "managed his steering-oar, and so broadly gaped - open-mouthed at times\n"
 "- that the mere sight of such a yawning commander, by sheer force of\n"
 "contrast, acted like a charm upon the crew. Then again, Stubb was one\n"
 "of those odd sort of humorists, whose jollity is sometimes so\n"
 "curiously ambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their guard in the\n"
 "matter of obeying them.\n"
 "\n"
 "In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely\n"
 "across Stubb's bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were\n"
 "pretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.  \"Mr. Starbuck!\n"
 "larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye please!\"\n"
 "\"Halloa!\" returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he\n"
 "spoke; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set\n"
 "like a flint from Stubb's.  \"What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!\"\n"
 "\"Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong,\n"
 "boys!\") in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: \"A sad\n"
 "business, Mr. Stubb!  (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never\n"
 "mind, Mr. Stubb, all for the best.  Let all your crew pull strong,\n"
 "come what will. (Spring, my men, spring!)\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " There's hogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr. Stubb, and that's what\n"
 "ye came for. (Pull, my boys!) Sperm, sperm's the play! This at least\n"
 "is duty; duty and profit hand in hand!\"  \"Aye, aye, I thought as\n"
 "much,\" soliloquized Stubb, when the boats diverged, \"as soon as I\n"
 "clapt eye on 'em, I thought so. Aye, and that's what he went into the\n"
 "after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy long suspected. They were\n"
 "hidden down there. The White Whale's at the bottom of it. Well, well,\n"
 "so be it! Can't be helped! All right! Give way, men! It ain't the\n"
 "White Whale to- day! Give way!\"  Now the advent of these outlandish\n"
 "strangers at such a critical instant as the lowering of the boats from\n"
 "the deck, this had not unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious\n"
 "amazement in some of the ship's company; but Archy's fancied discovery\n"
 "having some time previous got abroad among them, though indeed not\n"
 "credited then, this had in some small measure prepared them for the\n"
 "event. It took off the extreme edge of their wonder; and so what with\n"
 "all this and Stubb's confident way of accounting for their appearance,\n"
 "they were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings; though the\n"
 "affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as\n"
 "to dark Ahab's precise agency in the matter from the beginning. For\n"
 "me, I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen creeping on\n"
 "board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn, as well as the\n"
 "enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah.  Meantime, Ahab, out\n"
 "of hearing of his officers, having sided the furthest to windward, was\n"
 "still ranging ahead of the other boats; a circumstance bespeaking how\n"
 "potent a crew was pulling him. those tiger yellow creatures of his\n"
 "seemed all steel and whale-bone; like five trip-hammers they rose and\n"
 "fell with regular strokes of strength, which periodically started the\n"
 "boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a\n"
 "Mississippi steamer. As for Fedallah, who was seen pulling the\n"
 "harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and displayed\n"
 "his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale,\n"
 "clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon;\n"
 "while at the other end of the boat Ahab, with one\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " arm, like a fencer's, thrown half backward into the air, as\n"
 "if to counterbalance any tendency to trip: Ahab was seen steadily\n"
 "managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the\n"
 "White Whale had torn him. All at once the out-stretched arm gave a\n"
 "peculiar motion and then remained fixed, while the boat's five oars\n"
 "were seen simultaneously peaked. Boat and crew sat motionless on the\n"
 "sea. Instantly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way.\n"
 "The whales had irregularly settled bodily down into the blue, thus\n"
 "giving no distantly discernible token of the movement, though from his\n"
 "closer vicinity Ahab had observed it.  \"Every man look out along his\n"
 "oars!\" cried Starbuck. \"Thou, Queequeg, stand up!\"\n"
 "\n"
 "Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the\n"
 "savage stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off\n"
 "towards the spot where the chase had last been descried. Likewise upon\n"
 "the extreme stern of the boat where it was also triangularly\n"
 "platformed level with the gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly\n"
 "and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of\n"
 "a craft, and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.  Not very\n"
 "far distant Flask's boat was also lying breathlessly still; its\n"
 "commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a stout\n"
 "sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above the\n"
 "level of the stern platform. it is used for catching turns with the\n"
 "whale line. Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man's\n"
 "hand, and standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at\n"
 "the mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks. But\n"
 "little King-Post was small and short, and at the same time little\n"
 "King-Post was full of a large and tall ambition, so that this\n"
 "loggerhead stand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.  \"I\n"
 "can't see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to\n"
 "that.\"  Upon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady\n"
 "his way, swiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his\n"
 "lofty shoulders for a pedestal.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Good a mast-head as any, sir. Will you mount?\"  \"That I will,\n"
 "and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you fifty feet\n"
 "taller.\"  Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite\n"
 "planks of the boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented\n"
 "his flat palm to Flask's foot, and then putting Flask's hand on his\n"
 "hearse-plumed head and bidding him spring as he himself should toss,\n"
 "with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his\n"
 "shoulders. And here was Flask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm\n"
 "furnishing him with a breast-band to lean against and steady himself\n"
 "by.  At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what\n"
 "wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an\n"
 "erect posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most\n"
 "riotously perverse and cross- running seas.  Still more strange to see\n"
 "him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself, under such\n"
 "circumstances. But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic\n"
 "Daggoo was yet more curious; for sustaining himself with a cool,\n"
 "indifferent, easy, unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to\n"
 "every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form. On his broad\n"
 "back, flaxen- haired flask seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked\n"
 "nobler than the rider. Though truly vivacious, tumultuous,\n"
 "ostentatious little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience;\n"
 "but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro's lordly\n"
 "chest. So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the living\n"
 "magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her tides and her\n"
 "seasons for that.  Meanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such\n"
 "far-gazing solicitudes. The whales might have made one of their\n"
 "regular soundings, not a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that\n"
 "were the case, Stubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was\n"
 "resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe. He withdrew\n"
 "it from his hatband, where he always wore it aslant like a feather. He\n"
 "loaded it, and rammed home the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly\n"
 "had he ignited his match across the rough sand-paper of his hand, when\n"
 "Tashtego, his harpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to windward like\n"
 "two fixed stars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude\n"
 "to his seat,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry, \"Down, down all, and\n"
 "give way! - there they are!\"  To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of\n"
 "a herring, would have been visible at that moment; nothing but a\n"
 "troubled bit of greenish white water, and thin scattered puffs of\n"
 "vapor hovering over it, and suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like\n"
 "the confused scud from white rolling billows. The air around suddenly\n"
 "vibrated and tingled, as it were, like the air over intensely heated\n"
 "plates of iron. Beneath this atmospheric waving and curling, and\n"
 "partially beneath a thin layer of water, also, the whales were\n"
 "swimming. Seen in advance of all the other indications, the puffs of\n"
 "vapor they spouted, seemed their forerunning couriers and detached\n"
 "flying outriders.  All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one\n"
 "spot of troubled water and air. But it bade far to outstrip them; it\n"
 "flew on and on, as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid\n"
 "stream from the hills.  \"Pull, pull, my good boys,\" said Starbuck, in\n"
 "the lowest possible but intensest concentrated whisper to his men;\n"
 "while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of\n"
 "the bow, almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle\n"
 "compasses. He did not say much to his crew, though, nor did his crew\n"
 "say anything to him. Only the silence of the boat was at intervals\n"
 "startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers, now harsh with\n"
 "command, now soft with entreaty.  How different the loud little\n"
 "King-Post. \"Sing out and say something, my hearties. Roar and pull, my\n"
 "thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on their black backs, boys; only do\n"
 "that for me, and I'll sign over to you my Martha's Vineyard\n"
 "plantation, boys; including wife and children, boys. Lay me on - lay\n"
 "me on! O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring mad: See! see that\n"
 "white water!\" And so shouting, he pulled his hat from his head, and\n"
 "stamped up and down on it; then picking it up, flirted it far off upon\n"
 "the sea; and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat's stern\n"
 "like a crazed colt from the prairie.  \"Look at that chap now,\"\n"
 "philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his unlighted short pipe,\n"
 "mechanically retained between his teeth, at a short distance, followed\n"
 "after - \"He's got fits, that\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Flask has. Fits? yes, give him fits - that's the very word -\n"
 "pitch fits into 'em. Merrily, merrily, hearts-alive. Pudding for\n"
 "supper, you know; - merry's the word. Pull, babes - pull, sucklings -\n"
 "pull, all. But what the devil are you hurrying about? Softly, softly,\n"
 "and steadily, my men. Only pull, and keep pulling; nothing more. Crack\n"
 "all your backbones, and bite your knives in two - that's all. Take it\n"
 "easy - why don't ye take it easy, I say, and burst all your livers and\n"
 "lungs!\"  But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-\n"
 "yellow crew of his - these were words best omitted here; for you live\n"
 "under the blessed light of the evangelical land.  Only the infidel\n"
 "sharks in the audacious seas may give ear to such words, when, with\n"
 "tornado brow, and eyes of red murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped\n"
 "after his prey.  Meanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated\n"
 "specific allusions of Flask to \"that whale\", as he called the\n"
 "fictitious monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his\n"
 "boat's bow with its tail - these allusions of his were at times so\n"
 "vivid and life-like, that they would cause some one or two of his men\n"
 "to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder. But this was against all\n"
 "rule; for the oarsmen must put out their eyes, and ram a skewer\n"
 "through their necks; usage pronouncing that they must have no organs\n"
 "but ears, and no limbs but arms, in these critical moments.  It was a\n"
 "sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the omnipotent\n"
 "sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled along the\n"
 "eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling-green; the\n"
 "brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip for an instant on\n"
 "the knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that almost seemed\n"
 "threatening to cut it in two; the sudden profound dip into the watery\n"
 "glens and hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of\n"
 "the opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down its other side;\n"
 "- all these, with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and the\n"
 "shuddering gasps of the oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the ivory\n"
 "Pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails, like a\n"
 "wild hen after her screaming brood; - all this was thrilling. Not the\n"
 "raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat\n"
 "of his first battle; not the dead man's ghost encountering\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the first unknown phantom in the other world; - neither of\n"
 "these can feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who\n"
 "for the first time finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned\n"
 "circle of the hunted Sperm Whale.  The dancing white water made by the\n"
 "chase was now becoming more and more visible, owing to the increasing\n"
 "darkness of the dun cloud-shadows flung upon the sea. The jets of\n"
 "vapor no longer blended, but tilted everywhere to right and left; the\n"
 "whales seemed separating their wakes. The boats were pulled more\n"
 "apart; Starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to\n"
 "leeward. Our sail was now set, and, with the still rising wind, we\n"
 "rushed along; the boat going with such madness through the water, that\n"
 "the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being\n"
 "torn from the row- locks.  Soon we were running through a suffusing\n"
 "wide veil of mist; neither ship nor boat to be seen.  \"Give way, men,\"\n"
 "whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the sheet of his sail;\n"
 "\"there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes. There's\n"
 "white water again! - close to! Spring!\"  Soon after, two cries in\n"
 "quick succession on each side of us denoted that the other boats had\n"
 "got fast; but hardly were they overheard, when with a lightning-like\n"
 "hurtling whisper Starbuck said: \"Stand up!\" and Queequeg, harpoon in\n"
 "hand, sprang to his feet.  Though not one of the oarsmen was then\n"
 "facing the life and death peril so close to them ahead, yet with their\n"
 "eyes on the intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat,\n"
 "they knew that the imminent instant had come; they heard, too, an\n"
 "enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their\n"
 "litter.  Meanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist, the\n"
 "waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged\n"
 "serpents.  \"That's his hump. There, there, give it to him!\" whispered\n"
 "Starbuck.  A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the\n"
 "darted iron of Queequeg. Then all in one welded commotion came an\n"
 "invisible push from astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on\n"
 "a ledge; the sail collapsed and exploded; a\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " gush of scalding vapor shot up near by; something rolled and\n"
 "tumbled like an earthquake beneath us. The whole crew were half\n"
 "suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the white curdling\n"
 "cream of the squall. Squall, whale, and harpoon had all blended\n"
 "together; and the whale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped.  Though\n"
 "completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed. Swimming round it we\n"
 "picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale,\n"
 "tumbled back to our places. There we sat up to our knees in the sea,\n"
 "the water covering every rib and plank, so that to our downward gazing\n"
 "eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the\n"
 "bottom of the ocean.  The wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed\n"
 "their bucklers together; the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled\n"
 "around us like a white fire upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we\n"
 "were burning; immortal in these jaws of death!  In vain we hailed the\n"
 "other boats; as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a\n"
 "flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm. Meanwhile the\n"
 "driving scud, rack, and mist, grew darker with the shadows of night;\n"
 "no sign of the ship could be seen. The rising sea forbade all attempts\n"
 "to bale out the boat. The oars were useless as propellers, performing\n"
 "now the office of life- preservers. So, cutting the lashing of the\n"
 "water-proof match keg, after many failures Starbuck contrived to\n"
 "ignite the lamp in the lantern; then stretching it on a waif pole,\n"
 "handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this forlorn\n"
 "hope. There, then, he sat, holding up that imbecile candle in the\n"
 "heart of that almighty forlornness. There, then, he sat, the sign and\n"
 "symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly holding up hope in the midst\n"
 "of despair.  Wet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of\n"
 "ship or boat, we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. The mist\n"
 "still spread over the sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom\n"
 "of the boat. Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand\n"
 "to his ear. We all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards\n"
 "hitherto muffled by the storm. The sound came nearer and nearer; the\n"
 "thick mists were dimly parted by\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " a huge, vague form. Affrighted, we all sprang into the sea as\n"
 "the ship at last loomed into view, bearing right down upon us within a\n"
 "distance of not much more than its length.  Floating on the waves we\n"
 "saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant it tossed and gaped beneath\n"
 "the ship's bows like a chip at the base of a cataract; and then the\n"
 "vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no more till it came up\n"
 "weltering astern. Again we swam for it, were dashed against it by the\n"
 "seas, and were at last taken up and safely landed on board. Ere the\n"
 "squall came close to, the other boats had cut loose from their fish\n"
 "and returned to the ship in good time. The ship had given us up, but\n"
 "was still cruising, if haply it might light upon some token of our\n"
 "perishing, - an oar or a lance pole.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange\n"
 "mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a\n"
 "vast practical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and\n"
 "more than suspects that the joke is at nobody's expense but his\n"
 "own. However, nothing dispirits, and nothing seems worth while\n"
 "disputing. He bolts down all events, all creeds, and beliefs, and\n"
 "persuasions, all hard things visible and invisible, never mind how\n"
 "knobby; as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun\n"
 "flints. And as for small difficulties and worryings, prospects of\n"
 "sudden disaster, peril of life and limb; all these, and death itself,\n"
 "seem to him only sly, good-natured hits, and jolly punches in the side\n"
 "bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker. That odd sort of\n"
 "wayward mood I am speaking of, comes over a man only in some time of\n"
 "extreme tribulation; it comes in the very midst of his earnestness, so\n"
 "that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most momentous,\n"
 "now seems but a part of the general\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " joke. There is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed\n"
 "this free and easy sort of genial, desperado philosophy; and with it I\n"
 "now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod, and the great White\n"
 "Whale its object.  \"Queequeg,\" said I, when they had dragged me, the\n"
 "last man, to the deck, and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to\n"
 "fling off the water; \"Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of\n"
 "thing often happen?\" Without much emotion, though soaked through just\n"
 "like me, he gave me to understand that such things did often happen.\n"
 "\"Mr. Stubb,\" said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his\n"
 "oil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; \"Mr. Stubb, I\n"
 "think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our\n"
 "chief mate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent. I\n"
 "suppose then, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in\n"
 "a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman's discretion?\"\n"
 "\"Certain. I've lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off\n"
 "Cape Horn.\"  \"Mr. Flask,\" said I, turning to little King-Post, who was\n"
 "standing close by; \"you are experienced in these things, and I am\n"
 "not. Will you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this\n"
 "fishery, Mr. Flask, for an oarsman to break his own back pulling\n"
 "himself back-foremost into death's jaws?\"  \"Can't you twist that\n"
 "smaller?\" said Flask. \"Yes, that's the law. I should like to see a\n"
 "boat's crew backing water up to a whale face foremost. Ha, ha! the\n"
 "whale would give them squint for squint, mind that!\"  Here then, from\n"
 "three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statement of the entire\n"
 "case. Considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings in the water\n"
 "and consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters of common\n"
 "occurrence in this kind of life; considering that at the superlatively\n"
 "critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign my life into\n"
 "the hands of him who steered the boat - oftentimes a fellow who at\n"
 "that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling\n"
 "the craft with his own frantic stampings; considering that the\n"
 "particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " imputed to Starbuck's driving on to his whale almost in the\n"
 "teeth of a squall, and considering that Starbuck, notwithstanding, was\n"
 "famous for his great heedfulness in the fishery; considering that I\n"
 "belonged to this uncommonly prudent Starbuck's boat; and finally\n"
 "considering in what a devil's chase I was implicated, touching the\n"
 "White Whale: taking all things together, I say, I thought I might as\n"
 "well go below and make a rough draft of my will. \"Queequeg,\" said I,\n"
 "\"come along, you shall be my lawyer, executor, and legatee.\"  It may\n"
 "seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their last\n"
 "wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world more fond\n"
 "of that diversion. This was the fourth time in my nautical life that I\n"
 "had done the same thing. After the ceremony was concluded upon the\n"
 "present occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone was rolled away from\n"
 "my heart. Besides, all the days I should now live would be as good as\n"
 "the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a supplementary\n"
 "clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might be. I survived\n"
 "myself; my death and burial were locked up in my chest. I looked round\n"
 "me tranquilly and contentedly, like a quiet ghost with a clean\n"
 "conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault.  Now then,\n"
 "thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock, here goes\n"
 "a cool, collected dive at death and destruction, and the devil fetch\n"
 "the hindmost.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"Who would have thought it, Flask!\" cried Stubb; \"if I had\n"
 "but one leg you would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the\n"
 "plug-hole with my timber toe.  Oh! he's a wonderful old man!\"  \"I\n"
 "don't think it so strange, after all, on that account,\" said\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Flask. \"If his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a\n"
 "different thing. That would disable him; but he has one knee, and good\n"
 "part of the other left, you know.\"  \"I don't know that, my little man;\n"
 "I never yet saw him kneel.\"  Among whale-wise people it has often been\n"
 "argued whether, considering the paramount importance of his life to\n"
 "the success of the voyage, it is right for a whaling captain to\n"
 "jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase. So Tamerlane's\n"
 "soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes, whether that\n"
 "invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the\n"
 "fight.  But with Ahab the question assumed a modified\n"
 "aspect. Considering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in\n"
 "all times of danger; considering that the pursuit of whales is always\n"
 "under great and extraordinary difficulties; that every individual\n"
 "moment, indeed, then comprises a peril; under these circumstances is\n"
 "it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt?  As a\n"
 "general thing, the joint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly\n"
 "thought not.  Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would\n"
 "think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless\n"
 "vicissitudes of the chase, for the sake of being near the scene of\n"
 "action and giving his orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a\n"
 "boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt -\n"
 "above all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as that\n"
 "same boat's crew, he well knew that such generous conceits never\n"
 "entered the heads of the owners of the Pequod. Therefore he had not\n"
 "solicited a boat's crew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his\n"
 "desires on that head.  Nevertheless he had taken private measures of\n"
 "his own touching all that matter.  Until Cabaco's published discovery,\n"
 "the sailors had little foreseen it, though to be sure when, after\n"
 "being a little while out of port, all hands had concluded the\n"
 "customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service; when some\n"
 "time after this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the\n"
 "matter of making thole-pins with his own hands for what was thought to\n"
 "be one of the spare boats, and even solicitously cutting the small\n"
 "wooden skewers, which when the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow:\n"
 "when all this was observed in him, and particularly his solicitude in\n"
 "having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to\n"
 "make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and\n"
 "also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or\n"
 "clumsy cleat, as it is sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the\n"
 "boat's bow for bracing the knee against in darting or stabbing at the\n"
 "whale; when it was observed how often he stood up in that boat with\n"
 "his solitary knee fixed in the semi-circular depression in the cleat,\n"
 "and with the carpenter's chisel gouged out a little here and\n"
 "straightened it a little there; all these things, I say, had awakened\n"
 "much interest and curiosity at the time. But almost everybody supposed\n"
 "that this particular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with\n"
 "a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he had already revealed\n"
 "his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person.  But such a\n"
 "supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any\n"
 "boat's crew being assigned to that boat.  Now, with the subordinate\n"
 "phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned away; for in a whaler\n"
 "wonders soon wane. Besides, now and then such unaccountable odds and\n"
 "ends of strange nations come up from the unknown nooks and ash-holes\n"
 "of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers; and the ships\n"
 "themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing\n"
 "about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck, oars, whale-boats,\n"
 "canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and what not; that Beelzebub himself\n"
 "might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the\n"
 "captain, and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the\n"
 "forecastle.  But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the\n"
 "subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though\n"
 "still as it were somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned\n"
 "Fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the last. Whence he came in a\n"
 "mannerly world like this, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon\n"
 "evinced himself to be linked with Ahab's peculiar fortunes; nay, so\n"
 "far as to have some sort of a half- hinted influence; Heaven knows,\n"
 "but it might have been even authority over him; all this none\n"
 "knew. But one cannot sustain\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " an indifferent air concerning Fedallah. He was such a\n"
 "creature as civilized, domestic people in the temperate zone only see\n"
 "in their dreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom now and then\n"
 "glide among the unchanging Asiatic communities, especially the\n"
 "Oriental isles to the east of the continent - those insulated,\n"
 "immemorial, unalterable countries, which even in these modern days\n"
 "still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth's primal\n"
 "generations, when the memory of the first man was a distinct\n"
 "recollection, and all men his descendants, unknowing whence he came,\n"
 "eyed each other as real phantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon\n"
 "why they were created and to what end; when though, according to\n"
 "genesis, the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of men, the\n"
 "devils also, add the uncanonical Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Days, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had\n"
 "slowly swept across four several cruising-grounds; that off the\n"
 "Azores; off the Cape de Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being off\n"
 "the mouth of the Rio de la Plata; and the Carrol Ground, an unstaked,\n"
 "watery locality, southerly from St. Helena.  It was while gliding\n"
 "through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight night, when\n"
 "all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver; and, by their soft,\n"
 "suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery silence, not a\n"
 "solitude: on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance\n"
 "of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by the moon, it looked\n"
 "celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the\n"
 "sea. Fedallah first descried this jet. For of these moonlight nights,\n"
 "it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a look-out\n"
 "there, with the same precision as if it had been day. And yet, though\n"
 "herds of whales were seen by night, not one whaleman\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " in a hundred would venture a lowering for them. You may think\n"
 "with what emotions, then, the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched\n"
 "aloft at such unusual hours; his turban and the moon, companions in\n"
 "one sky. But when, after spending his uniform interval there for\n"
 "several successive nights without uttering a single sound; when, after\n"
 "all this silence, his unearthly voice was heard announcing that\n"
 "silvery, moon-lit jet, every reclining mariner started to his feet as\n"
 "if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging, and hailed the\n"
 "mortal crew. \"There she blows!\" Had the trump of judgment blown, they\n"
 "could not have quivered more; yet still they felt no terror; rather\n"
 "pleasure. for though it was a most unwonted hour, yet so impressive\n"
 "was the cry, and so deliriously exciting, that almost every soul on\n"
 "board instinctively desired a lowering.  Walking the deck with quick,\n"
 "side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the t'gallant sails and royals to\n"
 "be set, and every stunsail spread. The best man in the ship must take\n"
 "the helm. Then, with every mast-head manned, the piled-up craft rolled\n"
 "down before the wind. The strange, upheaving, lifting tendency of the\n"
 "taffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many sails, made the\n"
 "buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet; while still\n"
 "she rushed along, as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in\n"
 "her - one to mount direct to heaven, the other to drive yawingly to\n"
 "some horizontal goal. And had you watched Ahab's face that night, you\n"
 "would have thought that in him also two different things were\n"
 "warring. While his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck,\n"
 "every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin-tap. On life and\n"
 "death this old man walked. But though the ship so swiftly sped, and\n"
 "though from every eye, like arrows, the eager glances shot, yet the\n"
 "silvery jet was no more seen that night.  Every sailor swore he saw it\n"
 "once, but not a second time.  This midnight-spout had almost grown a\n"
 "forgotten thing, when, some days after, lo! at the same silent hour,\n"
 "it was again announced: again it was descried by all; but upon making\n"
 "sail to overtake it, once more it disappeared as if it had never\n"
 "been. And so it served us night after night, till no one heeded it but\n"
 "to wonder at it. Mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " or starlight, as the case might be; disappearing again for\n"
 "one whole day, or two days, or three; and somehow seeming at every\n"
 "distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our\n"
 "van, this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on.  Nor with the\n"
 "immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance with the\n"
 "preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things invested the\n"
 "Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever\n"
 "and wherever descried; at however remote times, or in however far\n"
 "apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast by one\n"
 "self-same whale; and that whale, Moby Dick. For a time, there reigned,\n"
 "too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition, as if it\n"
 "were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that the monster\n"
 "might turn round upon us, and rend us at last in the remotest and most\n"
 "savage seas.  These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful,\n"
 "derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the\n"
 "weather, in which, beneath all its blue blandness, some thought there\n"
 "lurked a devilish charm, as for days and days we voyaged along,\n"
 "through seas so wearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in\n"
 "repugnance to our vengeful errand, seemed vacating itself of life\n"
 "before our urn-like prow.  But, at last, when turning to the eastward,\n"
 "the Cape winds began howling around us, and we rose and fell upon the\n"
 "long, troubled seas that are there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod\n"
 "sharply bowed to the blast, and gored the dark waves in her madness,\n"
 "till, like showers of silver chips, the foam-flakes flew over her\n"
 "bulwarks; then all this desolate vacuity of life went away, but gave\n"
 "place to sights more dismal than before.  Close to our bows, strange\n"
 "forms in the water darted hither and thither before us; while thick in\n"
 "our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. And every morning, perched\n"
 "on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and spite of our\n"
 "hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp, as though\n"
 "they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft; a thing\n"
 "appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting-place for their\n"
 "homeless selves. And heaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved the\n"
 "black sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience; and the great\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and\n"
 "suffering it had bred.  Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather\n"
 "Cape Tormentoto, as called of yore; for long allured by the perfidious\n"
 "silences that before had attended us, we found ourselves launched into\n"
 "this tormented sea, where guilty beings transformed into those fowls\n"
 "and these fish, seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any\n"
 "haven in store, or beat that black air without any horizon. But calm,\n"
 "snow-white, and unvarying; still directing its fountain of feathers to\n"
 "the sky; still beckoning us on from before, the solitary jet would at\n"
 "times be descried.  During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab,\n"
 "though assuming for the time the almost continual command of the\n"
 "drenched and dangerous deck, manifested the gloomiest reserve; and\n"
 "more seldom than ever addressed his mates. In tempestuous times like\n"
 "these, after everything above and aloft has been secured, nothing more\n"
 "can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale. Then Captain\n"
 "and crew become practical fatalists. So, with his ivory leg inserted\n"
 "into its accustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud,\n"
 "Ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an\n"
 "occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very\n"
 "eyelashes together. Meantime, the crew driven from the forward part of\n"
 "the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows,\n"
 "stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better to\n"
 "guard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a\n"
 "sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a\n"
 "loosened belt.  Few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship, as\n"
 "if manned by painted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through all\n"
 "the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves. By night the\n"
 "same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed;\n"
 "still in silence the men swung in the bowlines; still wordless Ahab\n"
 "stood up to the blast. Even when wearied nature seemed demanding\n"
 "repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock. Never could\n"
 "Starbuck forget the old man's aspect, when one night going down into\n"
 "the cabin to mark how the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " barometer stood, he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight\n"
 "in his floor-screwed chair; the rain and half-melted sleet of the\n"
 "storm from which he had some time before emerged, still slowly\n"
 "dripping from the unremoved hat and coat. On the table beside him lay\n"
 "unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents which have\n"
 "previously been spoken of. His lantern swung from his tightly clenched\n"
 "hand. Though the body was erect, the head was thrown back so that the\n"
 "closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that\n"
 "swung from a beam in the ceiling.  Terrible old man! thought Starbuck\n"
 "with a shudder, sleeping in this gale, still thou steadfastly eyest\n"
 "thy purpose.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " South-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a\n"
 "good cruising ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the\n"
 "Goney (Albatross) by name. As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty\n"
 "perch at the fore-mast-head, I had a good view of that sight so\n"
 "remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries - a whaler at sea, and\n"
 "long absent from home.  As if the waves had been fullers, this craft\n"
 "was bleached like the skeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her\n"
 "sides, this spectral appearance was traced with long channels of\n"
 "reddened rust, while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick\n"
 "branches of trees furred over with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails\n"
 "were set. A wild sight it was to see her long-bearded look-outs at\n"
 "those three mast-heads. They seemed clad in the skins of beasts, so\n"
 "torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of\n"
 "cruising. Standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast, they swayed and\n"
 "swung over a fathomless sea;\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " and though, when the ship slowly glided close under our\n"
 "stern, we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we might\n"
 "almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one ship to those of the\n"
 "other; yet, those forlorn-looking fishermen, mildly eyeing us as they\n"
 "passed, said not one word to our own look-outs, while the quarter-\n"
 "deck hail was being heard from below.  \"Ship ahoy! Have ye seen the\n"
 "White Whale?\"  But as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid\n"
 "bulwarks, was in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it\n"
 "somehow fell from his hand into the sea; and the wind now rising\n"
 "amain, he in vain strove to make himself heard without it. Meantime\n"
 "his ship was still increasing the distance between. While in various\n"
 "silent ways the seamen of the Pequod were evincing their observance of\n"
 "this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whale's\n"
 "name to another ship, Ahab for a moment paused; it almost seemed as\n"
 "though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger, had not the\n"
 "threatening wind forbade. But taking advantage of his windward\n"
 "position, he again seized his trumpet, and knowing by her aspect that\n"
 "the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home, he\n"
 "loudly hailed - \"Ahoy there! This is the Pequod, bound round the\n"
 "world! Tell them to address all future letters to the Pacific ocean!\n"
 "and this time three years, if I am not at home, tell them to address\n"
 "them to - - \" At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and\n"
 "instantly, then, in accordance with their singular ways, shoals of\n"
 "small harmless fish, that for some days before had been placidly\n"
 "swimming by our side, darted away with what seemed shuddering fins,\n"
 "and ranged themselves fore and aft with the stranger's flanks. Though\n"
 "in the course of his continual voyagings Ahab must often before have\n"
 "noticed a similar sight, yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest\n"
 "trifles capriciously carry meanings.  \"Swim away from me, do ye?\"\n"
 "murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water. There seemed but little in\n"
 "the words, but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than\n"
 "the insane old man had ever before evinced. But turning to the\n"
 "steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to\n"
 "diminish\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " her headway, he cried out in his old lion voice, - \"Up helm!\n"
 "Keep her off round the world!\"  Round the world! There is much in that\n"
 "sound to inspire proud feelings; but whereto does all that\n"
 "circumnavigation conduct? Only through numberless perils to the very\n"
 "point whence we started, where those that we left behind secure, were\n"
 "all the time before us.  Were this world an endless plain, and by\n"
 "sailing eastward we could for ever reach new distances, and discover\n"
 "sights more sweet and strange than any Cyclades or Islands of King\n"
 "Solomon, then there were promise in the voyage. But in pursuit of\n"
 "those far mysteries we dream of, or in tormented chase of that demon\n"
 "phantom that, some time or other, swims before all human hearts; while\n"
 "chasing such over this round globe, they either lead us on in barren\n"
 "mazes or midway leave us whelmed. The cabin-compass is called the\n"
 "tell-tale, because without going to the compass at the helm, the\n"
 "Captain, while below, can inform himself of the course of the ship.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the\n"
 "whaler we had spoken was this: the wind and sea betokened storms. But\n"
 "even had this not been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have\n"
 "boarded her - judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions -\n"
 "if so it had been that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a\n"
 "negative answer to the question he put. For, as it eventually turned\n"
 "out, he cared not to consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger\n"
 "captain, except he could contribute some of that information he so\n"
 "absorbingly sought. But all this might remain inadequately estimated,\n"
 "were not something said here of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels\n"
 "when meeting each other in foreign seas, and especially on a common\n"
 "cruising-ground.  If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New\n"
 "York State, or the equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds,\n"
 "these twain, for the life of them, cannot well avoid a mutual\n"
 "salutation; and stopping for a moment to interchange the news; and,\n"
 "perhaps, sitting down for a while and resting in concert: then, how\n"
 "much more natural that upon the illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury\n"
 "Plains of the sea, two whaling vessels descrying each other at the\n"
 "ends of the earth - off lone Fanning's Island, or the far away King's\n"
 "Mills; how much more natural, I say, that under such circumstances\n"
 "these ships should not only interchange hails, but come into still\n"
 "closer, more friendly and sociable contact. And especially would this\n"
 "seem to be a matter of course, in the case of vessels owned in one\n"
 "seaport, and whose captains, officers, and not a few of the men are\n"
 "personally known to each other; and consequently, have all sorts of\n"
 "dear domestic things to talk about.  For the long absent ship, the\n"
 "outward- bounder, perhaps, has letters on board; at any rate, she will\n"
 "be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or two later than\n"
 "the last one on her blurred and thumb-worn files. And in return for\n"
 "that courtesy, the outward-bound ship would receive the latest whaling\n"
 "intelligence from the cruising-ground to which she may be destined, a\n"
 "thing of the utmost importance to her. And in degree, all this will\n"
 "hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each other's track on\n"
 "the cruising-ground itself, even though they are equally long absent\n"
 "from home. for one of them may have received a transfer of letters\n"
 "from some third, and now far remote vessel; and some of those letters\n"
 "may be for the people of the ship she now meets. Besides, they would\n"
 "exchange the whaling news, and have an agreeable chat. For not only\n"
 "would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors, but likewise with\n"
 "all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and\n"
 "mutually shared privations and perils.  Nor would difference of\n"
 "country make any very essential difference; that is, so long as both\n"
 "parties speak one language, as is the case with Americans and\n"
 "English. Though, to be sure, from the small number of English whalers,\n"
 "such meetings do not very often occur, and when they do occur there is\n"
 "too apt to be a sort of shyness between them; for your Englishman is\n"
 "rather\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " reserved, and your Yankee, he does not fancy that sort of\n"
 "thing in anybody but himself. Besides, the English whalers sometimes\n"
 "affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the American whalers;\n"
 "regarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his nondescript\n"
 "provincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. But where this superiority\n"
 "in the English whalemen does really consist, it would be hard to say,\n"
 "seeing that the Yankees in one day, collectively, kill more whales\n"
 "than all the English, collectively, in ten years. But this is a\n"
 "harmless little foible in the English whale-hunters, which the\n"
 "Nantucketer does not take much to heart; probably, because he knows\n"
 "that he has a few foibles himself.  So, then, we see that of all ships\n"
 "separately sailing the sea, the whalers have most reason to be\n"
 "sociable - and they are so. Whereas, some merchant ships crossing each\n"
 "other's wake in the mid-Atlantic, will oftentimes pass on without so\n"
 "much as a single word of recognition, mutually cutting each other on\n"
 "the high seas, like a brace of dandies in Broadway; and all the time\n"
 "indulging, perhaps, in finical criticism upon each other's rig. As for\n"
 "Men-of-War, when they chance to meet at sea, they first go through\n"
 "such a string of silly bowings and scrapings, such a ducking of\n"
 "ensigns, that there does not seem to be much right-down hearty\n"
 "good-will and brotherly love about it at all. As touching Slave-ships\n"
 "meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry, they run away from\n"
 "each other as soon as possible. And as for Pirates, when they chance\n"
 "to cross each other's cross-bones, the first hail is - \"How many\n"
 "skulls?\" - the same way that whalers hail - \"How many barrels?\" And\n"
 "that question once answered, pirates straightway steer apart, for they\n"
 "are infernal villains on both sides, and don't like to see overmuch of\n"
 "each other's villanous likenesses.\n"
 "\n"
 "But look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,\n"
 "free-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets another\n"
 "whaler in any sort of decent weather? She has a \"Gam\", a thing so\n"
 "utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name\n"
 "even; and if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it,\n"
 "and repeat gamesome stuff about \"spouters\" and \"blubber- boilers,\" and\n"
 "such like pretty exclamations. Why it is that all Merchant-seamen, and\n"
 "also all\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Pirates and Man-of-War's men, and Slave-ship sailors, cherish\n"
 "such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question it\n"
 "would be hard to answer.  Because, in the case of pirates, say, I\n"
 "should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar\n"
 "glory about it. It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but\n"
 "only at the gallows. And besides, when a man is elevated in that odd\n"
 "fashion, he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude. Hence,\n"
 "I conclude, that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a\n"
 "whaleman, in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on.\n"
 "But what is a Gam? You might wear out your index-finger running up and\n"
 "down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word. Dr. Johnson\n"
 "never attained to that erudition; Noah Webster's ark does not hold\n"
 "it. Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many years\n"
 "been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born\n"
 "Yankees. Certainly it needs a definition, and should be incorporated\n"
 "into the Lexicon. With that view, let me learnedly define it.\n"
 "GAM. Noun - A social meeting of two (or more) Whale-ships, generally\n"
 "on a cruising- ground; when, after exchanging hails, they exchange\n"
 "visits by boats' crews: the two captains remaining, for the time, on\n"
 "board of one ship, and the two chief mates on the other.  There is\n"
 "another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten\n"
 "here. All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail;\n"
 "so has the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when\n"
 "the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern\n"
 "sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often\n"
 "steers himself with a pretty little milliner's tiller decorated with\n"
 "gay cords and ribbons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa\n"
 "of that sort whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if\n"
 "whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty\n"
 "old aldermen in patent chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat\n"
 "never admits of any such effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a\n"
 "complete boat's crew must leave the ship, and hence as the boat\n"
 "steerer or harpooneer is of the number, that subordinate is the\n"
 "steersman upon the occasion, and the captain, having no\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing like\n"
 "a pine tree. And often you will notice that being conscious of the\n"
 "eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the\n"
 "two ships, this standing captain is all alive to the importance of\n"
 "sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs.  nor is this any very\n"
 "easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar\n"
 "hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the after-oar\n"
 "reciprocating by rapping his knees in front. He is thus completely\n"
 "wedged before and behind, and can only expand himself sideways by\n"
 "settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden, violent pitch of\n"
 "the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of foundation\n"
 "is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make a spread angle\n"
 "of two poles, and you cannot stand them up.  Then, again, it would\n"
 "never do in plain sight of the world's riveted eyes, it would never\n"
 "do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself\n"
 "the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands;\n"
 "indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command, he generally\n"
 "carries his hands in his trowsers' pockets; but perhaps being\n"
 "generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for\n"
 "ballast. Nevertheless there have occurred instances, well\n"
 "authenticated ones too, where the captain has been known for an\n"
 "uncommonly critical moment or two, in a sudden squall say - to seize\n"
 "hold of the nearest oarsman's hair, and hold on there like grim death.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " As told at the Golden Inn The Cape of Good Hope, and all the\n"
 "watery region round about there, is much like some noted four corners\n"
 "of a great highway, where you meet more travellers than in any other\n"
 "part.  It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " homeward-bound whaleman, the Town-Ho, was encountered. She\n"
 "was manned almost wholly by Polynesians. In the short gam that ensued\n"
 "she gave us strong news of Moby Dick. To some the general interest in\n"
 "the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the\n"
 "Town-Ho's story, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a\n"
 "certain wondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called\n"
 "judgments of God which at times are said to overtake some men. This\n"
 "latter circumstance, with its own particular accompaniments, forming\n"
 "what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be\n"
 "narrated, never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates. For\n"
 "that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the\n"
 "Town-Ho himself. It was the private property of three confederate\n"
 "white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems, communicated it to\n"
 "Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secresy, but the following night\n"
 "Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and revealed so much of it in that way,\n"
 "that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the\n"
 "rest. Nevertheless, so potent an influence did this thing have on\n"
 "those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it, and\n"
 "by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in this\n"
 "matter, that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never\n"
 "transpired abaft the Pequod's main-mast. Interweaving in its proper\n"
 "place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the\n"
 "ship, the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on lasting\n"
 "record.  For my humor's sake, I shall preserve the style in which I\n"
 "once narrated it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends,\n"
 "one saint's eve, smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the\n"
 "Golden Inn. Of those fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and\n"
 "Sebastian, were on the closer terms with me; and hence the interluding\n"
 "questions they occasionally put, and which are duly answered at the\n"
 "time.  \"Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I\n"
 "am about rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Whaler of Nantucket, was cruising in your Pacific here, not\n"
 "very many days' sail westward from the eaves of this good Golden\n"
 "Inn. She was somewhere to the northward of the Line. One morning upon\n"
 "handling the pumps, according to daily usage, it was observed that she\n"
 "made more water in her hold than common. They supposed a sword-fish\n"
 "had stabbed her, gentlemen. But the captain, having some unusual\n"
 "reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those\n"
 "latitudes; and therefore being very averse to quit them, and the leak\n"
 "not being then considered at all dangerous, though, indeed, they could\n"
 "not find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in\n"
 "rather heavy weather, the ship still continued her cruisings, the\n"
 "mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals; but no good\n"
 "luck came; more days went by, and not only was the leak yet\n"
 "undiscovered, but it sensibly increased. So much so, that now taking\n"
 "some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood away for the nearest\n"
 "harbor among the islands, there to have his hull hove out and\n"
 "repaired.  \"Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the\n"
 "commonest chance favored, he did not at all fear that his ship would\n"
 "founder by the way, because his pumps were of the best, and being\n"
 "periodically relieved at them, those six-and-thirty men of his could\n"
 "easily keep the ship free; never mind if the leak should double on\n"
 "her. In truth, well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by\n"
 "very prosperous breezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in\n"
 "perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least\n"
 "fatality, had it not been for the brutal overbearing of Radney, the\n"
 "mate, a Vineyarder, and the bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt,\n"
 "a Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo.  \"\"Lakeman! - Buffalo! Pray,\n"
 "what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?\" said Don Sebastian, rising\n"
 "in his swinging mat of grass.  \"On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie,\n"
 "Don; but - I crave your courtesy - may be, you shall soon hear further\n"
 "of all that. Now, gentlemen, in square- sail brigs and three-masted\n"
 "ships, well-nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of\n"
 "your old Callao to far manilla; this lakeman, in the land-locked heart\n"
 "of our America, had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open\n"
 "ocean. For in their interflowing aggregate, those grand fresh-water\n"
 "seas of ours - Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and Superior, and\n"
 "Michigan, - possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many of the\n"
 "ocean's noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of races and\n"
 "of climes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles, even as\n"
 "the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by two great\n"
 "contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long maritime\n"
 "approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East, dotted\n"
 "all round their banks; here and there are frowned upon by batteries,\n"
 "and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they have heard\n"
 "the fleet thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they yield\n"
 "their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from\n"
 "out their peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by\n"
 "ancient and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like\n"
 "serried lines of kings in Gothic genealogies; those same woods\n"
 "harboring wild Afric beasts of prey, and silken creatures whose\n"
 "exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors; they mirror the paved\n"
 "capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland, as well as Winnebago villages; they\n"
 "float alike the full-rigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser of the\n"
 "State, the steamer, and the beech canoe; they are swept by Borean and\n"
 "dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave; they\n"
 "know what shipwrecks are, for out of sight of land, however inland,\n"
 "they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking\n"
 "crew. Thus, gentlemen, though an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean\n"
 "born, and wild-ocean nurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as\n"
 "any. And for Radney, though in his infancy he may have laid him down\n"
 "on the lone Nantucket beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in\n"
 "after life he had long followed our austere Atlantic and your\n"
 "contemplative Pacific; yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social\n"
 "quarrel as the backwoods seaman, fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn\n"
 "handled Bowie-knives. Yet was this Nantucketer a man with some\n"
 "good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a mariner, who though a sort of\n"
 "devil indeed, might yet by inflexible firmness, only tempered by that\n"
 "common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave's\n"
 "right; thus\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " treated, this Steelkilt had long been retained harmless and\n"
 "docile. At all events, he had proved so thus far; but Radney was\n"
 "doomed and made mad, and Steelkilt - but, gentlemen, you shall hear.\n"
 "\"It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her\n"
 "prow for her island haven, that the Town-Ho's leak seemed again\n"
 "increasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps\n"
 "every day. You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like\n"
 "our Atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping their\n"
 "whole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should the\n"
 "officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the\n"
 "probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again\n"
 "remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to the\n"
 "bottom. Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the\n"
 "westward, gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep\n"
 "clanging at their pump- handles in full chorus even for a voyage of\n"
 "considerable length; that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible\n"
 "coast, or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them. It is only\n"
 "when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those\n"
 "waters, some really landless latitude, that her captain begins to feel\n"
 "a little anxious.  \"Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so\n"
 "when her leak was found gaining once more, there was in truth some\n"
 "small concern manifested by several of her company; especially by\n"
 "radney the mate. He commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted,\n"
 "sheeted home anew, and every way expanded to the breeze. Now this\n"
 "Radney, I suppose, was as little of a coward, and as little inclined\n"
 "to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any\n"
 "fearless, unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can\n"
 "conveniently imagine, gentlemen.  Therefore when he betrayed this\n"
 "solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the seamen declared\n"
 "that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her. So when\n"
 "they were working that evening at the pumps, there was on this head no\n"
 "small gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood with their\n"
 "feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water; clear as any\n"
 "mountain spring, gentlemen - that bubbling from\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the pumps ran across the deck, and poured itself out in\n"
 "steady spouts at the lee scupper-holes.  Now, as you well know, it is\n"
 "not seldom the case in this conventional world of ours - watery or\n"
 "otherwise; that when a person placed in command over his fellow-men\n"
 "finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in general\n"
 "pride of manhood, straightway against that man he conceives an\n"
 "unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a chance he will\n"
 "pull down and pulverize that subaltern's tower, and make a little heap\n"
 "of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may, gentlemen, at all\n"
 "events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman,\n"
 "and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last\n"
 "viceroy's snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and a soul in\n"
 "him, gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he been born\n"
 "son to Charlemagne's father. But Radney, the mate, was ugly as a mule;\n"
 "yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious. He did not love Steelkilt,\n"
 "and Steelkilt knew it.  Espying the mate drawing near as he was\n"
 "toiling at the pump with the rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice\n"
 "him, but unawed, went on with his gay banterings.\n"
 "\n"
 "\"\"Aye, aye, my merry lads, it's a lively leak this; hold a cannikin,\n"
 "one of ye, and let's have a taste. By the Lord, it's worth bottling! I\n"
 "tell ye what, men, old Rad's investment must go for it! he had best\n"
 "cut away his part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that\n"
 "sword- fish only began the job; he's come back again with a gang of\n"
 "ship- carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole\n"
 "posse of 'em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom;\n"
 "making improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I'd tell him\n"
 "to jump overboard and scatter 'em. They're playing the devil with his\n"
 "estate, I can tell him. But he's a simple old soul, - Rad, and a\n"
 "beauty too.  Boys, they say the rest of his property is invested in\n"
 "looking-glasses. I wonder if he'd give a poor devil like me the model\n"
 "of his nose.\"\"  \"\"Damn your eyes! what's that pump stopping for?\"\n"
 "roared Radney, pretending not to have heard the sailors'\n"
 "talk. \"Thunder away at it!\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"\"Aye, aye, sir,\" said Steelkilt, merry as a\n"
 "cricket. \"Lively, boys, lively, now!\" And with that the pump clanged\n"
 "like fifty fire-engines; the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere\n"
 "long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the\n"
 "fullest tension of life's utmost energies.  \"Quitting the pump at\n"
 "last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went forward all panting,\n"
 "and sat himself down on the windlass; his face fiery red, his eyes\n"
 "bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow. Now what\n"
 "cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney to meddle with\n"
 "such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know not; but so\n"
 "it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate commanded\n"
 "him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a shovel, and\n"
 "remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at\n"
 "large.  \"Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a piece of\n"
 "household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly\n"
 "attended to every evening; it has been known to be done in the case of\n"
 "ships actually foundering at the time.  Such, gentlemen, is the\n"
 "inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in\n"
 "seamen; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing\n"
 "their faces. But in all vessels this broom business is the\n"
 "prescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard. Besides,\n"
 "it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into\n"
 "gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most athletic seaman\n"
 "of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of\n"
 "the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial\n"
 "business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the case\n"
 "with his comrades. I mention all these particulars so that you may\n"
 "understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.  \"But\n"
 "there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as\n"
 "plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat\n"
 "in his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will\n"
 "understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman\n"
 "fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat\n"
 "still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's\n"
 "malignant eye and\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him and the\n"
 "slow- match silently burning along towards them; as he instinctively\n"
 "saw all this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up\n"
 "the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being - a repugnance\n"
 "most felt, when felt at all, by really valiant men even when aggrieved\n"
 "- this nameless phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.\n"
 "\"Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily\n"
 "exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping\n"
 "the deck was not his business, and he would not do it. and then,\n"
 "without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the\n"
 "customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done\n"
 "little or nothing all day. To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a\n"
 "most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his\n"
 "command; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an\n"
 "uplifted cooper's club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near\n"
 "by.  Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the\n"
 "pumps, for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating\n"
 "Steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow\n"
 "still smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he\n"
 "remained doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed Radney\n"
 "shook the hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding\n"
 "him to do his bidding.  \"Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round\n"
 "the windlass, steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer,\n"
 "deliberately repeated his intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that\n"
 "his forbearance had not the slightest effect, by an awful and\n"
 "unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish\n"
 "and infatuated man; but it was to no purpose. And in this way the two\n"
 "went once slowly round the windlass; when, resolved at last no longer\n"
 "to retreat, bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as\n"
 "comported with his humor, the Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus\n"
 "spoke to the officer: \"\"Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that\n"
 "hammer away, or look to yourself.\"  But the predestinated mate coming\n"
 "still closer to him, where the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth; meanwhile repeating\n"
 "a string of insufferable maledictions. Retreating not the thousandth\n"
 "part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard\n"
 "of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching his right hand behind him and\n"
 "creepingly drawing it back, told his persecutor that if the hammer but\n"
 "grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would murder him. But, gentlemen, the\n"
 "fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods.  Immediately the\n"
 "hammer touched the cheek; the next instant the lower jaw of the mate\n"
 "was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a\n"
 "whale.  \"Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the\n"
 "backstays leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing\n"
 "their mast-heads. They were both Canallers.  \"\"Canallers!\" cried Don\n"
 "Pedro, \"We have seen many whale-ships in our harbors, but never heard\n"
 "of your Canallers. Pardon: who and what are they?\"  \"\"Canallers, Don,\n"
 "are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal. You must have heard\n"
 "of it.\"  \"\"Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and\n"
 "hereditary land, we know but little of your vigorous North.\"  \"\"Aye?\n"
 "Well then, Don, refill my cup. Your chicha's very fine; and ere\n"
 "proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for such\n"
 "information may throw side-light upon my story.\"  \"For three hundred\n"
 "and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire breadth of the state of\n"
 "New York; through numerous populous cities and most thriving villages;\n"
 "through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and affluent, cultivated\n"
 "fields, unrivalled for fertility; by billiard-room and bar-room;\n"
 "through the holy-of-holies of great forests; on Roman arches over\n"
 "Indian rivers; through sun and shade; by happy hearts or broken;\n"
 "through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk\n"
 "counties; and especially, by rows of snow-white chapels, whose spires\n"
 "stand almost like milestones, flows one continual stream of Venetianly\n"
 "corrupt and often lawless life. There's your true Ashantee, gentlemen;\n"
 "there howl your pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you;\n"
 "under the long-flung shadow, and the snug patronizing lee of\n"
 "churches. For by some curious fatality, as it is often noted of your\n"
 "metropolitan freebooters\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " that they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so\n"
 "sinners, gentlemen, most abound in holiest vicinities.  \"\"Is that a\n"
 "friar passing?\" said Don Pedro, looking downwards into the crowded\n"
 "plazza, with humorous concern.  \"\"Well for our northern friend, Dame\n"
 "Isabella's Inquisition wanes in Lima,\" laughed Don\n"
 "Sebastian. \"Proceed, Senor.\"  \"\"A moment! Pardon!\" cried another of\n"
 "the company. \"In the name of all us Limeese, I but desire to express\n"
 "to you, sir sailor, that we have by no means overlooked your delicacy\n"
 "in not substituting present Lima for distant Venice in your corrupt\n"
 "comparison. Oh! do not bow and look surprised; you know the proverb\n"
 "all along this coast - \"Corrupt as Lima\". It but bears out your\n"
 "saying, too; churches more plentiful than billiard-tables, and for\n"
 "ever open - and \"Corrupt as Lima\". So, too, Venice; I have been there;\n"
 "the holy city of the blessed evangelist, St. Mark! - St. Dominic,\n"
 "purge it! Your cup! Thanks: here I refill; now, you pour out again.\"\n"
 "\"Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would\n"
 "make a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is\n"
 "he. Like Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed,\n"
 "flowery Nile, he indolently floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked\n"
 "Cleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck. But ashore,\n"
 "all this effeminacy is dashed. The brigandish guise which the Canaller\n"
 "so proudly sports; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his\n"
 "grand features. A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages\n"
 "through which he floats; his swart visage and bold swagger are not\n"
 "unshunned in cities. Once a vagabond on his own canal, I have received\n"
 "good turns from one of these Canallers; I thank him heartily; would\n"
 "fain be not ungrateful; but it is often one of the prime redeeming\n"
 "qualities of your man of violence, that at times he has as stiff an\n"
 "arm to back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy\n"
 "one. In sum, gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is, is\n"
 "emphatically evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so\n"
 "many of its most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of\n"
 "mankind, except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling\n"
 "captains. Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter,\n"
 "that to many thousands of our\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " rural boys and young men born along its line, the\n"
 "probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition\n"
 "between quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, and recklessly\n"
 "ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.  \"\"I see! I see! \"\n"
 "impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his chicha upon his silvery\n"
 "ruffles. \"No need to travel! The world's one Lima. I had thought, now,\n"
 "that at your temperate North the generations were cold and holy as the\n"
 "hills. - But the story.\"  \"I left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman\n"
 "shook the back-stay. Hardly had he done so, when he was surrounded by\n"
 "the three junior mates and the four harpooneers, who all crowded him\n"
 "to the deck. But sliding down the ropes like baleful comets, the two\n"
 "Canallers rushed into the uproar, and sought to drag their man out of\n"
 "it towards the forecastle. Others of the sailors joined with them in\n"
 "this attempt, and a twisted turmoil ensued; while standing out of\n"
 "harm's way, the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale-pike,\n"
 "calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and\n"
 "smoke him along to the quarter-deck. At intervals, he ran close up to\n"
 "the revolving border of the confusion, and prying into the heart of it\n"
 "with his pike, sought to prick out the object of his resentment. But\n"
 "Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all; they\n"
 "succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing about\n"
 "three or four large casks in a line with the windlass, these\n"
 "sea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade.  \"\"Come out\n"
 "of that, ye pirates!\" roared the captain, now menacing them with a\n"
 "pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. \"Come out of\n"
 "that, ye cut- throats!\"  \"Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and\n"
 "striding up and down there, defied the worst the pistols could do; but\n"
 "gave the captain to understand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt's)\n"
 "death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all\n"
 "hands. Fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true, the\n"
 "captain a little desisted, but still commanded the insurgents\n"
 "instantly to return to their duty.  \"\"Will you promise not to touch\n"
 "us, if we do?\" demanded their ringleader.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"\"Turn to! turn to! - I make no promise; - to your duty! Do\n"
 "you want to sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? Turn\n"
 "to!\" and he once more raised a pistol.  \"\"Sink the ship?\" cried\n"
 "Steelkilt. \"Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us turns to, unless you\n"
 "swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us. What say ye, men?\" turning\n"
 "to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their response.  \"The Lakeman now\n"
 "patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye on the Captain,\n"
 "and jerking out such sentences as these: - \"It's not our fault; we\n"
 "didn't want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was boy's\n"
 "business; he might have known me before this; I told him not to prick\n"
 "the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here against his cursed\n"
 "jaw; ain't those mincing knives down in the forecastle there, men?\n"
 "look to those handspikes, my hearties.  Captain, by God, look to\n"
 "yourself; say the word; don't be a fool; forget it all; we are ready\n"
 "to turn to; treat us decently, and we're your men; but we won't be\n"
 "flogged.\"  \"\"Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!\"  \"\"Look ye,\n"
 "now,\" cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him. \"there are\n"
 "a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped for the\n"
 "cruise, d'ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our\n"
 "discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don't want a row; it's\n"
 "not our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but\n"
 "we won't be flogged.\"  \"\"Turn to!\" roared the Captain.  \"Steelkilt\n"
 "glanced round him a moment, and then said: - \"I tell you what it is\n"
 "now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a shabby\n"
 "rascal, we won't lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us; but till\n"
 "you say the word about not flogging us, we won't do a hand's turn.\"\n"
 "\"\"Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I'll keep ye there till\n"
 "ye're sick of it. Down ye go.\"  \"\"Shall we?\" cried the ringleader to\n"
 "his men. Most of them were against it; but at length, in obedience to\n"
 "Steelkilt, they preceded him down into their dark den, growlingly\n"
 "disappearing, like bears into a cave.  \"As the Lakeman's bare head was\n"
 "just level with the planks,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the Captain and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly\n"
 "drawing over the slide of the scuttle, planted their group of hands\n"
 "upon it, and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass\n"
 "padlock, belonging to the companion-way. Then opening the slide a\n"
 "little, the Captain whispered something down the crack, closed it, and\n"
 "turned the key upon them - ten in number - leaving on deck some twenty\n"
 "or more, who thus far had remained neutral.  \"All night a wide-awake\n"
 "watch was kept by all the officers, forward and aft, especially about\n"
 "the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at which last place it was\n"
 "feared the insurgents might emerge, after breaking through the\n"
 "bulkhead below. But the hours of darkness passed in peace; the men who\n"
 "still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps, whose clinking\n"
 "and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded\n"
 "through the ship.  \"At sunrise the captain went forward, and knocking\n"
 "on the deck, summoned the prisoners to work; but with a yell they\n"
 "refused. Water was then lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls\n"
 "of biscuit were tossed after it; when again turning the key upon them\n"
 "and pocketing it, the Captain returned to the quarter-deck. Twice\n"
 "every day for three days this was repeated; but on the fourth morning\n"
 "a confused wrangling, and then a scuffling was heard, as the customary\n"
 "summons was delivered; and suddenly four men burst up from the\n"
 "forecastle, saying they were ready to turn to. The fetid closeness of\n"
 "the air, and a famishing diet, united perhaps to some fears of\n"
 "ultimate retribution, had constrained them to surrender at\n"
 "discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain reiterated his demand to\n"
 "the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his\n"
 "babbling and betake himself where he belonged. On the fifth morning\n"
 "three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the\n"
 "desperate arms below that sought to restrain them. Only three were\n"
 "left.  \"\"Better turn to, now?\" said the Captain with a heartless jeer.\n"
 "\"\"Shut us up again, will ye!\" cried Steelkilt.  \"\"Oh! certainly,\" said\n"
 "the Captain and the key clicked.  \"It was at this point, gentlemen,\n"
 "that enraged by the defection\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " of seven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking\n"
 "voice that had last hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in\n"
 "a place as black as the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt\n"
 "proposed to the two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with\n"
 "him, to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison;\n"
 "and armed with their keen mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy\n"
 "implements with a handle at each end) run a muck from the bowsprit to\n"
 "the taffrail; and if by any devilishness of desperation possible,\n"
 "seize the ship. For himself, he would do this, he said, whether they\n"
 "joined him or not. That was the last night he should spend in that\n"
 "den. but the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other\n"
 "two; they swore they were ready for that, or for any other mad thing,\n"
 "for anything in short but a surrender. And what was more, they each\n"
 "insisted upon being the first man on deck, when the time to make the\n"
 "rush should come. But to this their leader as fiercely objected,\n"
 "reserving that priority for himself; particularly as his two comrades\n"
 "would not yield, the one to the other, in the matter; and both of them\n"
 "could not be first, for the ladder would but admit one man at a\n"
 "time. And here, gentlemen, the foul play of these miscreants must come\n"
 "out.  \"Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his\n"
 "own separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same\n"
 "piece of treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order\n"
 "to be the first of the three, though the last of the ten, to\n"
 "surrender; and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such\n"
 "conduct might merit. But when Steelkilt made known his determination\n"
 "still to lead them to the last, they in some way, by some subtle\n"
 "chemistry of villany, mixed their before secret treacheries together;\n"
 "and when their leader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to\n"
 "each other in three sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and\n"
 "gagged him with cords; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight.\n"
 "\"Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he\n"
 "and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In\n"
 "a few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the\n"
 "still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his\n"
 "perfidious allies, who at once claimed the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " honor of securing a man who had been fully ripe for\n"
 "murder. But all these were collared, and dragged along the deck like\n"
 "dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the mizen rigging,\n"
 "like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till morning. \"Damn\n"
 "ye,\" cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them, \"the vultures\n"
 "would not touch ye, ye villains!\"  \"At sunrise he summoned all hands;\n"
 "and separating those who had rebelled from those who had taken no part\n"
 "in the mutiny, he told the former that he had a good mind to flog them\n"
 "all round - thought, upon the whole, he would do so - he ought to -\n"
 "justice demanded it; but for the present, considering their timely\n"
 "surrender, he would let them go with a reprimand, which he accordingly\n"
 "administered in the vernacular.  \"\"But as for you, ye carrion rogues,\"\n"
 "turning to the three men in the rigging - \"for you, I mean to mince ye\n"
 "up for the try-pots;\" and, seizing a rope, he applied it with all his\n"
 "might to the backs of the two traitors, till they yelled no more, but\n"
 "lifelessly hung their heads sideways, as the two crucified thieves are\n"
 "drawn.  \"\"My wrist is sprained with ye!\" he cried, at last; \"but there\n"
 "is still rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn't give\n"
 "up. Take that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for\n"
 "himself.\"  \"For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous\n"
 "motion of his cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his\n"
 "head, said in a sort of hiss, \"What I say is this - and mind it well -\n"
 "- if you flog me, I murder you!\"  \"\"Say ye so? then see how ye\n"
 "frighten me\" - and the Captain drew off with the rope to strike.\n"
 "\"\"Best not,\" hissed the Lakeman.  \"\"But I must,\" - and the rope was\n"
 "once more drawn back for the stroke.  \"Steelkilt here hissed out\n"
 "something, inaudible to all but the Captain; who, to the amazement of\n"
 "all hands, started back, paced the deck rapidly two or three times,\n"
 "and then suddenly throwing down his rope, said,\"I won't do it - let\n"
 "him go - cut him down: d'ye hear?\"  \"But as the junior mates were\n"
 "hurrying to execute the order,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " a pale man, with a bandaged head, arrested them - Radney the\n"
 "chief mate. Ever since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that\n"
 "morning, hearing the tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus\n"
 "far had watched the whole scene. Such was the state of his mouth, that\n"
 "he could hardly speak; but mumbling something about his being willing\n"
 "and able to do what the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the\n"
 "rope and advanced to his pinioned foe.  \"\"You are a coward!\" hissed\n"
 "the Lakeman.  \"\"So I am, but take that.\" The mate was in the very act\n"
 "of striking, when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and\n"
 "then pausing no more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt's threat,\n"
 "whatever that might have been. The three men were then cut down, all\n"
 "hands were turned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the\n"
 "iron pumps clanged as before.  \"Just after dark that day, when one\n"
 "watch had retired below, a clamor was heard in the forecastle; and the\n"
 "two trembling traitors running up, besieged the cabin door, saying\n"
 "they durst not consort with the crew. Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks\n"
 "could not drive them back, so at their own instance they were put down\n"
 "in the ship's run for salvation. Still, no sign of mutiny reappeared\n"
 "among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed, that mainly at Steelkilt's\n"
 "instigation, they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness,\n"
 "obey all orders to the last, and, when the ship reached port, desert\n"
 "her in a body. But in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage,\n"
 "they all agreed to another thing - namely, not to sing out for whales,\n"
 "in case any should be discovered. For, spite of her leak, and spite of\n"
 "all her other perils, the Town-Ho still maintained her mast-heads, and\n"
 "her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment, as on\n"
 "the day his craft first struck the cruising ground; and Radney the\n"
 "mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat, and with his\n"
 "bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale.  \"But\n"
 "though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of\n"
 "passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till\n"
 "all was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the\n"
 "man who had stung him in the ventricles\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " of his heart. He was in Radney the chief mate's watch; and as\n"
 "if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his\n"
 "doom, after the scene at the rigging, he insisted, against the express\n"
 "counsel of the captain, upon resuming the head of his watch at\n"
 "night. Upon this, and one or two other circumstances, Steelkilt\n"
 "systematically built the plan of his revenge.  \"During the night,\n"
 "Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the\n"
 "quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which\n"
 "was hoisted up there, a little above the ship's side. In this\n"
 "attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a\n"
 "considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between\n"
 "this was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his\n"
 "next trick at the helm would come round at two o'clock, in the morning\n"
 "of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his\n"
 "leisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully\n"
 "in his watches below.  \"\"What are you making there?\" said a shipmate.\n"
 "\"\"What do you think? what does it look like?\"  \"\"Like a lanyard for\n"
 "your bag; but it's an odd one, seems to me.\"  \"\"Yes, rather oddish,\"\n"
 "said the Lakeman, holding it at arm's length before him; \"but I think\n"
 "it will answer. Shipmate, I haven't enough twine, - have you any?\"\n"
 "\"But there was none in the forecastle.  \"\"Then I must get some from\n"
 "old Rad;\" and he rose to go aft.  \"\"You don't mean to go a begging to\n"
 "him!\" said a sailor.  \"\"Why not? Do you think he won't do me a turn,\n"
 "when it's to help himself in the end, shipmate?\" and going to the\n"
 "mate, he looked at him quietly, and asked him for some twine to mend\n"
 "his hammock. It was given him - neither twine nor lanyard were seen\n"
 "again; but the next night an iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled\n"
 "from the pocket of the Lakeman's monkey jacket, as he was tucking the\n"
 "coat into his hammock for a pillow. Twenty-four hours after, his trick\n"
 "at the silent helm - nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the\n"
 "grave always ready dug to the seaman's hand - that fatal hour was then\n"
 "to come; and in\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the fore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already\n"
 "stark and stretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.  \"But,\n"
 "gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody deed he\n"
 "had planned. Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the\n"
 "avenger. For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in\n"
 "to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have\n"
 "done.  \"It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the\n"
 "second day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid\n"
 "Teneriffe man, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted\n"
 "out, \"There she rolls! there she rolls!\"  Jesu, what a whale! It was\n"
 "Moby Dick.  \"\"Moby Dick!\" cried Don Sebastian; \"St. Dominic! Sir\n"
 "sailor, but do whales have christenings? Whom call you Moby Dick?\"\n"
 "\"\"A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster, Don; -\n"
 "but that would be too long a story.\"  \"\"How? how!\" cried all the young\n"
 "Spaniards, crowding.  \"\"Nay, Dons, Dons - nay, nay! I cannot rehearse\n"
 "that now. Let me get more into the air, Sirs.\"  \"\"The chicha! the\n"
 "chicha!\" cried Don Pedro; \"our vigorous friend looks faint; - fill up\n"
 "his empty glass!\"  \"No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed. -\n"
 "Now, gentlemen, so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty\n"
 "yards of the ship - forgetful of the compact among the crew - in the\n"
 "excitement of the moment, the Teneriffe man had instinctively and\n"
 "involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster, though for some little\n"
 "time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen\n"
 "mast-heads. All was now a phrensy. \"The White Whale - the White\n"
 "Whale!\" was the cry from captain, mates, and harpooneers, who,\n"
 "undeterred by fearful rumors, were all anxious to capture so famous\n"
 "and precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed askance, and with\n"
 "curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass, that lit up by a\n"
 "horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a living opal in\n"
 "the blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the whole\n"
 "career of these events, as if verily mapped out before the world\n"
 "itself was charted.  The mutineer was the bowsman of the mate, and\n"
 "when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him, while Radney\n"
 "stood\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or slacken the\n"
 "line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats were\n"
 "lowered, the mate's got the start; and none howled more fiercely with\n"
 "delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a stiff\n"
 "pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to\n"
 "the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat. And now his\n"
 "bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale's topmost back. Nothing\n"
 "loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding foam that\n"
 "blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat struck as\n"
 "against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the standing\n"
 "mate. That instant, as he fell on the whale's slippery back, the boat\n"
 "righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed\n"
 "over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck out\n"
 "through the spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that\n"
 "veil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick.  But\n"
 "the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer\n"
 "between his jaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong\n"
 "again, and went down.  \"Meantime, at the first tap of the boat's\n"
 "bottom, the Lakeman had slackened the line, so as to drop astern from\n"
 "the whirlpool; calmly looking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a\n"
 "sudden, terrific, downward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his\n"
 "knife to the line. He cut it; and the whale was free. But, at some\n"
 "distance, Moby Dick rose again, with some tatters of Radney's red\n"
 "woollen shirt, caught in the teeth that had destroyed him. All four\n"
 "boats gave chase again; but the whale eluded them, and finally wholly\n"
 "disappeared.  In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port - a savage,\n"
 "solitary place - where no civilized creature resided. There, headed by\n"
 "the Lakeman, all but five or six of the foremast-men deliberately\n"
 "deserted among the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a\n"
 "large double war- canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some\n"
 "other harbor.  The ship's company being reduced to but a handful, the\n"
 "captain called upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious\n"
 "business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak. But to such\n"
 "unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " band of whites necessitated, both by night and by day, and so\n"
 "extreme was the hard work they underwent, that upon the vessel being\n"
 "ready again for sea, they were in such a weakened condition that the\n"
 "captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel. After taking\n"
 "counsel with his officers, he anchored the ship as far off shore as\n"
 "possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows; stacked his\n"
 "muskets on the poop; and warning the Islanders not to approach the\n"
 "ship at their peril, took one man with him, and setting the sail of\n"
 "his best whale-boat, steered straight before the wind for Tahiti, five\n"
 "hundred miles distant, to procure a reinforcement to his crew.  On the\n"
 "fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which seemed to\n"
 "have touched at a low isle of corals. He steered away from it; but the\n"
 "savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed\n"
 "him to heave to, or he would run him under water. the captain\n"
 "presented a pistol. With one foot on each prow of the yoked\n"
 "war-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if the\n"
 "pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles\n"
 "and foam.  \"\"What do you want of me?\" cried the captain.  \"\"Where are\n"
 "you bound? and for what are you bound?\" demanded Steelkilt; \"no lies.\"\n"
 "\"\"I am bound to Tahiti for more men.\"  \"\"Very good. Let me board you a\n"
 "moment - I come in peace.\" With that he leaped from the canoe, swam to\n"
 "the boat; and climbing the gunwale, stood face to face with the\n"
 "captain.  \"\"Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat\n"
 "after me. As soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat\n"
 "on yonder island, and remain there six days. If I do not, may\n"
 "lightnings strike me!\"  \"\"A pretty scholar,\" laughed the\n"
 "Lakeman.\"Adios, Senor!\" and leaping into the sea, he swam back to his\n"
 "comrades.  \"Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up\n"
 "to the roots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in\n"
 "due time arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination. There, luck\n"
 "befriended him; two ships were about to sail for France, and were\n"
 "providentially in want of precisely that number\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " of men which the sailor headed. They embarked; and so for\n"
 "ever got the start of their former captain, had he been at all minded\n"
 "to work them legal retribution.  \"Some ten days after the French ships\n"
 "sailed, the whale-boat arrived, and the captain was forced to enlist\n"
 "some of the more civilized Tahitians, who had been somewhat used to\n"
 "the sea. Chartering a small native schooner, he returned with them to\n"
 "his vessel; and finding all right there, again resumed his cruisings.\n"
 "Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of\n"
 "Nantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to\n"
 "give up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that\n"
 "destroyed him.  \"\"Are you through?\" said Don Sebastian, quietly.  \"\"I\n"
 "am, Don.\"  \"\"Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own\n"
 "convictions, this story is in substance really true? It is so passing\n"
 "wonderful! Did you get it from an unquestionable source? Bear with me\n"
 "if I seem to press.\"  \"\"Also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we\n"
 "all join in Don Sebastian's suit,\" cried the company, with exceeding\n"
 "interest.  \"\"Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden\n"
 "Inn, gentlemen?\"  \"\"Nay,\" said Don Sebastian; \"but I know a worthy\n"
 "priest near by, who will quickly procure one for me. I go for it; but\n"
 "are you well advised? this may grow too serious.\"  \"\"Will you be so\n"

 "appears to the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the\n"
 "whale is moored alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly\n"
 "stepped upon there. It may be worth while, therefore, previously to\n"
 "advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to\n"
 "the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman. It is\n"
 "time to set the world right in this matter, by proving such pictures\n"
 "of the whale all wrong.  It may be that the primal source of all those\n"
 "pictorial delusions will be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian,\n"
 "and Grecian sculptures. For ever since those inventive but\n"
 "unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings of temples, the\n"
 "pedestals of statues, and on shields, medallions, cups, and coins, the\n"
 "dolphin was drawn in scales of chain-armor like Saladin's, and a\n"
 "helmeted head like St.  George's; ever since then has something of the\n"
 "same sort of license prevailed, not only in most popular pictures of\n"
 "the whale, but in many scientific presentations of him.  Now, by all\n"
 "odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the\n"
 "whale's, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of Elephanta, in\n"
 "India. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of\n"
 "that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits, every conceivable\n"
 "avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of them actually\n"
 "came into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our noble\n"
 "profession\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " of whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The Hindoo\n"
 "whale referred to, occurs in a separate department of the wall,\n"
 "depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of Leviathan,\n"
 "learnedly known as the Matse Avatar. But though this sculpture is half\n"
 "man and half whale, so as only to give the tail of the latter, yet\n"
 "that small section of him is all wrong. It looks more like the\n"
 "tapering tail of an anaconda, than the broad palms of the true whale's\n"
 "majestic flukes.  But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great\n"
 "Christian painter's portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better\n"
 "than the antediluvian Hindoo.  It is Guido's picture of Perseus\n"
 "rescuing Andromeda from the sea- monster or whale. Where did Guido get\n"
 "the model of such a strange creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in\n"
 "painting the same scene in his own \"Perseus Descending\", make out one\n"
 "whit better. The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates\n"
 "on the surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water. It has a sort of\n"
 "howdah on its back, and its distended tusked mouth into which the\n"
 "billows are rolling, might be taken for the Traitors' Gate leading\n"
 "from the Thames by water into the Tower.  Then, there are the\n"
 "Prodromus whales of the old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah's whale, as\n"
 "depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers. What\n"
 "shall be said of these? As for the book-binder's whale winding like a\n"
 "vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor - as stamped and\n"
 "gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both old and new -\n"
 "that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature, imitated, I\n"
 "take it, from the like figures on antique vases. Though universally\n"
 "denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless call this book-binder's fish an\n"
 "attempt at a whale; because it was so intended when the device was\n"
 "first introduced. It was introduced by an old Italian publisher\n"
 "somewhere about the 15th century, during the Revival of Learning; and\n"
 "in those days, and even down to a comparatively late period, dolphins\n"
 "were popularly supposed to be a species of the Leviathan.  In the\n"
 "vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at\n"
 "times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all manner of\n"
 "spouts, jets d'eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and Baden-Baden,\n"
 "come bubbling up from his\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " unexhausted brain. In the title-page of the original edition\n"
 "of the \"Advancement of Learning\" you will find some curious whales.\n"
 "But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those\n"
 "pictures of Leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations,\n"
 "by those who know.  In old Harris's collection of voyages there are\n"
 "some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages,\n"
 "A. D. 1671, entitled \"A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship\n"
 "Jonas in the Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.\" In one of\n"
 "those plates the whales, like great rafts of logs, are represented\n"
 "lying among ice-isles, with white bears running over their living\n"
 "backs. In another plate, the prodigious blunder is made of\n"
 "representing the whale with perpendicular flukes.  Then again, there\n"
 "is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain Colnett, a Post Captain\n"
 "in the English navy, entitled \"A Voyage round Cape Horn into the South\n"
 "Seas, for the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale Fisheries.\" In\n"
 "this book is an outline purporting to be a \"Picture of a Physeter or\n"
 "Spermaceti Whale, drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of\n"
 "Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on deck.  I doubt not the captain\n"
 "had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines. To\n"
 "mention but one thing about it, let me say that it has an eye which\n"
 "applied, according to the accompanying scale, to a full grown Sperm\n"
 "Whale, would make the eye of that whale a bow-window some five feet\n"
 "long. Ah, my gallant captain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out\n"
 "of that eye!  Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural\n"
 "History for the benefit of the young and tender, free from the same\n"
 "heinousness of mistake. Look at that popular work \"Goldsmith's\n"
 "Animated Nature\". In the abridged London edition of 1807, there are\n"
 "plates of an alleged \"whale\" and a \"narwhale\". I do not wish to seem\n"
 "inelegant, but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow;\n"
 "and, as for the Narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one,\n"
 "that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for\n"
 "genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys.  Then, again, in\n"
 "1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lace�p�de,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " a great naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale\n"
 "book, wherein are several pictures of the different species of the\n"
 "Leviathan. All these are not only incorrect, but the picture of the\n"
 "Mysticetus or Greenland Whale (that is to say, the Right Whale), even\n"
 "Scoresby, a long experienced man as touching that species, declares\n"
 "not to have its counterpart in nature.  But the placing of the\n"
 "cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was reserved for the\n"
 "scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous Baron. In 1836, he\n"
 "published a Natural History of Whales, in which he gives what he calls\n"
 "a picture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that picture to any\n"
 "Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary retreat from\n"
 "Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier's Sperm Whale is not a Sperm\n"
 "Whale, but a squash. Of course, he never had the benefit of a whaling\n"
 "voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived that picture, who\n"
 "can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the same\n"
 "field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions; that is, from a\n"
 "Chinese drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the pencil those\n"
 "Chinese are, many queer cups and saucers inform us.  As for the\n"
 "sign-painters' whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of\n"
 "oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally Richard\n"
 "III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage; breakfasting on\n"
 "three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of mariners: their\n"
 "deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint.  But these\n"
 "manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising\n"
 "after all. Consider! Most of the scientific drawings have been taken\n"
 "from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a drawing of\n"
 "a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent the noble\n"
 "animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars. Though\n"
 "elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living Leviathan has\n"
 "never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The living whale,\n"
 "in his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen at sea in\n"
 "unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight,\n"
 "like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a\n"
 "thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " him bodily into the air, so as to preserve all his mighty\n"
 "swells and undulations. And, not to speak of the highly presumable\n"
 "difference of contour between a young sucking whale and a full- grown\n"
 "Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of one of those young\n"
 "sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck, such is then the outlandish,\n"
 "eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that his precise expression\n"
 "the devil himself could not catch.  But it may be fancied, that from\n"
 "the naked skeleton of the stranded whale, accurate hints may be\n"
 "derived touching his true form. Not at all. For it is one of the more\n"
 "curious things about this Leviathan, that his skeleton gives very\n"
 "little idea of his general shape. Though Jeremy Bentham's skeleton,\n"
 "which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors,\n"
 "correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed utilitarian old\n"
 "gentleman, with all Jeremy's other leading personal characteristics;\n"
 "yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any Leviathan's\n"
 "articulated bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the mere\n"
 "skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested\n"
 "and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so\n"
 "roundingly envelopes it. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the\n"
 "head, as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is\n"
 "also very curiously displayed in the side fin, the bones of which\n"
 "almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand, minus only the\n"
 "thumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers, the index, middle,\n"
 "ring, and little finger. But all these are permanently lodged in their\n"
 "fleshy covering, as the human fingers in an artificial\n"
 "covering. \"However recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us,\" said\n"
 "humorous Stubb one day, \"he can never be truly said to handle us\n"
 "without mittens\".  For all these reasons, then, any way you may look\n"
 "at it, you must needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one\n"
 "creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last. True,\n"
 "one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another, but none can\n"
 "hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness. So there is no\n"
 "earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks\n"
 "like. And the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea\n"
 "of his living contour, is by\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small\n"
 "risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to\n"
 "me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this\n"

 "OF WHALES, AND TH\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am\n"
 "strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories\n"
 "of them which are to be found in certain books, both ancient and\n"
 "modern, especially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier,\n"
 "&c.. But I pass that matter by.  I know of only four published\n"
 "outlines of the great Sperm Whale; Colnett's, Huggins's, Frederick\n"
 "Cuvier's, and Beale's. In the previous chapter Colnett and Cuvier have\n"
 "been referred to. Huggins's is far better than theirs; but, by great\n"
 "odds, Beale's is the best. All Beale's drawings of this whale are\n"
 "good, excepting the middle figure in the picture of three whales in\n"
 "various attitudes, capping his second chapter. His frontispiece, boats\n"
 "attacking Sperm Whales, though no doubt calculated to excite the civil\n"
 "scepticism of some parlor men, is admirably correct and life-like in\n"
 "its general effect. Some of the Sperm Whale drawings in J. Ross Browne\n"
 "are pretty correct in contour; but they are wretchedly engraved. That\n"
 "is not his fault though.  Of the Right Whale, the best outline\n"
 "pictures are in Scoresby; but they are drawn on too small a scale to\n"
 "convey a desirable impression. He has but one picture of whaling\n"
 "scenes, and this is a sad deficiency, because it is by such pictures\n"
 "only, when at all well done, that you can derive anything like a\n"
 "truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living hunters.  But,\n"
 "taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details not\n"
 "the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " scenes to be anywhere found, are two large French engravings,\n"
 "well executed, and taken from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively,\n"
 "they represent attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale. In the first\n"
 "engraving a noble Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might,\n"
 "just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and\n"
 "bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven\n"
 "planks. The prow of the boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just\n"
 "balancing upon the monster's spine; and standing in that prow, for\n"
 "that one single incomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman,\n"
 "half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the\n"
 "act of leaping, as if from a precipice. The action of the whole thing\n"
 "is wonderfully good and true. The half-emptied line-tub floats on the\n"
 "whitened sea; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob\n"
 "in it; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in\n"
 "contrasting expressions of affright; while in the black stormy\n"
 "distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene. Serious fault might\n"
 "be found with the anatomical details of this whale, but let that pass;\n"
 "since, for the life of me, I could not draw so good a one.  In the\n"
 "second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the\n"
 "barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his black\n"
 "weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the Patagonian\n"
 "cliffs. His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so that from so\n"
 "abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there must be a\n"
 "brave supper cooking in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are pecking\n"
 "at the small crabs, shell- fish, and other sea candies and maccaroni,\n"
 "which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back. And all\n"
 "the while the thick-lipped Leviathan is rushing through the deep,\n"
 "leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, and causing the\n"
 "slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the\n"
 "paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer. Thus, the foreground is all raging\n"
 "commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic contrast, is the glassy\n"
 "level of a sea becalmed, the drooping unstarched sails of the\n"
 "powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead whale, a conquered\n"
 "fortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole\n"
 "inserted into his spout-hole.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life\n"
 "for it he was either practically conversant with his subject, or else\n"
 "marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman. The French are the\n"
 "lads for painting action. Go and gaze upon all the paintings in\n"
 "Europe, and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing\n"
 "commotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at Versailles; where\n"
 "the beholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the consecutive great\n"
 "battles of France; where every sword seems a flash of the Northern\n"
 "Lights, and the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by, like a\n"
 "charge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly unworthy of a place in that\n"
 "gallery, are these sea battle-pieces of Garnery.  The natural aptitude\n"
 "of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of things seems to be\n"
 "peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of their\n"
 "whaling scenes. With not one tenth of England's experience in the\n"
 "fishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the Americans, they\n"
 "have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished\n"
 "sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale\n"
 "hunt. For the most part, the English and American whale draughtsmen\n"
 "seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of\n"
 "things, such as the vacant profile of the whale; which, so far as\n"
 "picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is about tantamount to\n"
 "sketching the profile of a pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly renowned\n"
 "Right Whaleman, after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland\n"
 "Whale, and three or four delicate miniatures of Narwhales and\n"
 "porpoises, treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat\n"
 "hooks, chopping knives, and grapnels; and with the microscopic\n"
 "diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering\n"
 "world ninety-six fac- similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals. I\n"
 "mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager (I honor him for a\n"
 "veteran), but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight\n"
 "not to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before\n"
 "a Greenland Justice of the Peace.  In addition to those fine\n"
 "engravings from Garnery, there are two other French engravings worthy\n"
 "of note, by some one who subscribes himself \"H. Durand\". One of them,\n"
 "though not precisely\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " adapted to our present purpose, nevertheless deserves mention\n"
 "on other accounts.  It is a quiet noon-scene among the isles of the\n"
 "Pacific; a French whaler anchored, inshore, in a calm, and lazily\n"
 "taking water on board; the loosened sails of the ship, and the long\n"
 "leaves of the palms in the background, both drooping together in the\n"
 "breezeless air. The effect is very fine, when considered with\n"
 "reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few\n"
 "aspects of oriental repose. The other engraving is quite a different\n"
 "affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in the very heart of\n"
 "the Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside; the vessel (in the\n"
 "act of cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to a quay; and a\n"
 "boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity, is about\n"
 "giving chase to whales in the distance. The harpoons and lances lie\n"
 "levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole;\n"
 "while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands\n"
 "half-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse. From the ship, the\n"
 "smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke\n"
 "over a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud, rising up\n"
 "with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the activity of\n"
 "the excited seamen.  moby_057.html/Chapter lvii - OF WHALES IN PAINT;\n"

 " On Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may\n"
 "have seen a crippled beggar (or kedger, as the sailors say) holding a\n"
 "painted board before him, representing the tragic scene in which he\n"
 "lost his leg. There are three whales and three boats; and one of the\n"
 "boats (presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original\n"
 "integrity) is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale.  Any\n"
 "time these ten years, they tell me, has that man held up that picture,\n"
 "and exhibited\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " that stump to an incredulous world. But the time of his\n"
 "justification has now come. His three whales are as good whales as\n"
 "were ever published in Wapping, at any rate; and his stump as\n"
 "unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western\n"
 "clearings. But, though for ever mounted on that stump, never a\n"
 "stump-speech does the poor whaleman make; but, with downcast eyes,\n"
 "stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation.  Throughout the\n"
 "Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and Sag Harbor, you\n"
 "will come across lively sketches of whales and whaling-scenes, graven\n"
 "by the fishermen themselves on Sperm Whale-teeth, or ladies' busks\n"
 "wrought out of the Right Whale- bone, and other like skrimshander\n"
 "articles, as the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious\n"
 "contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material, in\n"
 "their hours of ocean leisure. Some of them have little boxes of\n"
 "dentistical-looking implements, specially intended for the\n"
 "skrimshandering business. But, in general, they toil with their\n"
 "jack-knives alone; and, with that almost omnipotent tool of the\n"
 "sailor, they will turn you out anything you please, in the way of a\n"
 "mariner's fancy.  Long exile from Christendom and civilization\n"
 "inevitably restores a man to that condition in which God placed him,\n"
 "i. e. what is called savagery. Your true whale-hunter is as much a\n"
 "savage as an Iroquois. I myself am a savage; owning no allegiance but\n"
 "to the King of the Cannibals; and ready at any moment to rebel against\n"
 "him.  Now, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his\n"
 "domestic hours, is his wonderful patience of industry. An ancient\n"
 "Hawaiian war-club or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and\n"
 "elaboration of carving, is as great a trophy of human perseverance as\n"
 "a Latin lexicon. For, with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark's\n"
 "tooth, that miraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been achieved;\n"
 "and it has cost steady years of steady application.  As with the\n"
 "Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage. With the same\n"
 "marvellous patience, and with the same single shark's tooth, of his\n"
 "one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not\n"
 "quite as workmanlike, but as close\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " packed in its maziness of design, as the Greek savage,\n"
 "Achilles's shield; and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness, as\n"
 "the prints of that fine old Dutch savage, Albert Durer.  Wooden\n"
 "whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the\n"
 "noble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met with in the forecastles\n"
 "of American whalers. Some of them are done with much accuracy.  At\n"
 "some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by\n"
 "the tail for knockers to the road-side door. When the porter is\n"
 "sleepy, the anvil-headed whale would be best. But these knocking\n"
 "whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays. On the spires of some\n"
 "old-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for\n"
 "weather- cocks; but they are so elevated, and besides that are to all\n"
 "intents and purposes so labelled with \"Hands off!\" you cannot examine\n"
 "them closely enough to decide upon their merit.  In bony, ribby\n"
 "regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken cliffs masses\n"
 "of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain, you will\n"
 "often discover images as of the petrified forms of the Leviathan\n"
 "partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks against them in a\n"
 "surf of green surges.  Then, again, in mountainous countries where the\n"
 "traveller is continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and\n"
 "there from some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of\n"
 "the profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges. But you\n"
 "must be a thorough whaleman, to see these sights; and not only that,\n"
 "but if you wish to return to such a sight again, you must be sure and\n"
 "take the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first\n"
 "stand-point, else so chance- like are such observations of the hills,\n"
 "that your precise, previous stand-point would require a laborious\n"
 "re-discovery; like the Solomon islands, which still remain incognita,\n"
 "though once high-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuera chronicled\n"
 "them.  Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to\n"
 "trace out great whales in the starry heavens, and boats in pursuit of\n"
 "them; as when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw\n"
 "armies locked in battle among the clouds. Thus at the North have I\n"
 "chased Leviathan round and round\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the Pole with the revolutions of the bright points that first\n"
 "defined him to me.  And beneath the effulgent Antarctic skies I have\n"
 "boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined the chase against the starry Cetus\n"
 "far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and the Flying Fish.  With a\n"
 "frigate's anchors for my bridle- bitts and fasces of harpoons for\n"

 "and golden wheat.  On the second day, numbers of Right Whales were\n"
 "seen, who, secure from the attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod,\n"
 "with open jaws sluggishly swam through the brit, which, adhering to\n"

 "was in that manner separated from the water that escaped at the lip.\n"

 "their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so\n"
 "these monsters swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound; and\n"
 "leaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit\n"
 "which at all reminded one of mowers. Seen from the mast-heads,\n"
 "especially when they paused and were stationary for a while, their\n"
 "vast black forms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than\n"
 "anything else. And as in the great hunting countries of India, the\n"
 "stranger at a distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent\n"
 "elephants without knowing them to be such, taking them for bare,\n"
 "blackened elevations of the soil; even so, often, with him, who for\n"
 "the first time beholds this species of the Leviathans of the sea. And\n"
 "even when recognised at last, their immense magnitude renders it very\n"
 "hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can\n"
 "possibly be instinct, in all parts, with the same sort of life that\n"
 "lives in a dog or a horse.  Indeed, in other respects, you can hardly\n"
 "regard any creatures of the deep with the same feelings that you do\n"
 "those of the shore. For though some old naturalists have maintained\n"
 "that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea; and\n"
 "though taking a broad general view of the thing, this may very well\n"
 "be; yet coming to specialties, where, for example, does the ocean\n"
 "furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness\n"
 "of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be\n"
 "said to bear comparative analogy to him.  But though, to landsmen in\n"
 "general, the native inhabitants of the seas have ever been regarded\n"
 "with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling; though we know the\n"
 "sea to be an everlasting terra incognita, so that Columbus sailed over\n"
 "numberless unknown worlds to discover his one superficial western one;\n"
 "though, by vast odds, the most terrific of all mortal disasters have\n"
 "immemorially and indiscriminately befallen tens and hundreds of\n"
 "thousands of those who have gone upon the waters; though but a\n"
 "moment's consideration will teach, that however baby man may brag of\n"
 "his science and skill, and however much, in a flattering future, that\n"
 "science and skill may augment; yet for ever and for ever, to the crack\n"
 "of doom, the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize the\n"
 "stateliest, stiffest frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the\n"
 "continual repetition of these\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " very impressions, man has lost that sense of the full\n"
 "awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it.  The first boat\n"
 "we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese vengeance had\n"
 "whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow. That same\n"
 "ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of last\n"
 "year. Yea, foolish mortals, Noah's flood is not yet subsided; two\n"
 "thirds of the fair world it yet covers.  Wherein differ the sea and\n"
 "the land, that a miracle upon one is not a miracle upon the other?\n"
 "Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews, when under the feet of\n"
 "Korah and his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up for\n"
 "ever; yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in precisely the same manner\n"
 "the live sea swallows up ships and crews.  But not only is the sea\n"
 "such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it is also a fiend to its\n"
 "own offspring; worse than the Persian host who murdered his own\n"
 "guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned. Like a\n"
 "savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs, so\n"
 "the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks, and leaves\n"
 "them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships. No mercy, no\n"
 "power but its own controls it. Panting and snorting like a mad battle\n"
 "steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean overruns the\n"
 "globe.  Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded\n"
 "creatures glide under water, unapparent for the most part, and\n"
 "treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure. Consider\n"
 "also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most\n"
 "remorseless tribes, as the dainty embellished shape of many species of\n"
 "sharks. Consider, once more, the universal cannibalism of the sea; all\n"
 "whose creatures prey upon each other, carrying on eternal war since\n"
 "the world began.  Consider all this; and then turn to this green,\n"
 "gentle, and most docile earth; consider them both, the sea and the\n"
 "land; and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself?\n"
 "For as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul\n"
 "of man there lies one insular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but\n"
 "encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " God keep thee! Push not off from that isle, thou canst never\n"
 "return! That part of the sea known among whalemen as the \"Brazil\n"
 "Banks\" does not bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do,\n"
 "because of there being shallows and soundings there, but because of\n"
 "this remarkable meadow-like appearance, caused by the vast drifts of\n"
 "brit continually floating in those latitudes, where the Right Whale is\n"
 "often chased.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Slowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still\n"
 "held on her way north-eastward towards the island of Java; a gentle\n"
 "air impelling her keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three\n"
 "tall tapering masts mildly waved to that languid breeze, as three mild\n"
 "palms on a plain. And still, at wide intervals in the silvery night,\n"
 "the lonely, alluring jet would be seen.  But one transparent blue\n"
 "morning, when a stillness almost preternatural spread over the sea,\n"
 "however unattended with any stagnant calm; when the long burnished\n"
 "sun- glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across them,\n"
 "enjoining some secresy; when the slippered waves whispered together as\n"
 "they softly ran on; in this profound hush of the visible sphere a\n"
 "strange spectre was seen by Daggoo from the main- mast-head.  In the\n"
 "distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher and\n"
 "higher, and disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed\n"
 "before our prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills. Thus\n"
 "glistening for a moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank. Then once\n"
 "more arose, and silently gleamed. It seemed not a whale; and yet is\n"
 "this Moby Dick? thought Daggoo. Again the phantom went down, but on\n"
 "re-appearing once more, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every\n"
 "man from his nod, the negro yelled out - \"There! there again! there\n"
 "she breaches!  right ahead! The White Whale, the White Whale!\"  Upon\n"
 "this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time the bees\n"
 "rush to the boughs. Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab stood on the\n"
 "bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his\n"
 "orders to the helmsman, cast\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the\n"
 "outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo.  Whether the flitting\n"
 "attendance of the one still and solitary jet had gradually worked upon\n"
 "Ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect the ideas of mildness and\n"
 "repose with the first sight of the particular whale he pursued;\n"
 "however this was, or whether his eagerness betrayed him; whichever way\n"
 "it might have been, no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white\n"
 "mass, than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for\n"
 "lowering.  The four boats were soon on the water; Ahab's in advance,\n"
 "and all swiftly pulling towards their prey. Soon it went down, and\n"
 "while, with oars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in\n"
 "the same spot where it sank, once more it slowly rose. Almost\n"
 "forgetting for the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at\n"
 "the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto\n"
 "revealed to mankind. A vast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and\n"
 "breadth, of a glancing cream-color, lay floating on the water,\n"
 "innumerable long arms radiating from its centre, and curling and\n"
 "twisting like a nest of anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any\n"
 "hapless object within reach. No perceptible face or front did it have;\n"
 "no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct; but undulated\n"
 "there on the billows, an unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition\n"
 "of life.  As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again,\n"
 "Starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a\n"
 "wild voice exclaimed - \"Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought\n"
 "him, than to have seen thee, thou white ghost!\"  \"What was it, Sir?\"\n"
 "said Flask.  \"The great live Squid, which they say, few whale-ships\n"
 "ever beheld, and returned to their ports to tell of it.\"  But Ahab\n"
 "said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the vessel; the rest\n"
 "as silently following.  Whatever superstitions the Sperm Whalemen in\n"
 "general have connected with the sight of this object, certain it is,\n"
 "that a glimpse of it being so very unusual, that circumstance has gone\n"
 "far to invest it with portentousness. So rarely is it beheld, that\n"
 "though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing\n"
 "in the ocean, yet very few of them have any but\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and form;\n"
 "notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the Sperm Whale his\n"
 "only food. For though other species of whales find their food above\n"
 "water, and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the Spermaceti\n"
 "Whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the surface; and\n"
 "only by inference is it that any one can tell of what, precisely, that\n"
 "food consists. At times, when closely pursued, he will disgorge what\n"
 "are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid; some of them thus\n"
 "exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length. They fancy that\n"
 "the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to\n"
 "the bed of the ocean; and that the Sperm Whale, unlike other species,\n"
 "is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it.  There seems\n"
 "some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop Pontoppodan may\n"
 "ultimately resolve itself into Squid. The manner in which the Bishop\n"
 "describes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with some other\n"
 "particulars he narrates, in all this the two correspond. But much\n"
 "abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns\n"
 "it.  By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the\n"
 "mysterious creature, here spoken of, it is included among the class of\n"
 "cuttle-fish, to which, indeed, in certain external respects it would\n"
 "seem to belong, but only as the Anak of the tribe.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described,\n"
 "as well as for the better understanding of all similar scenes\n"
 "elsewhere presented, I have here to speak of the magical, sometimes\n"
 "horrible whale-line.  The line originally used in the fishery was of\n"
 "the best hemp, slightly vapored with tar, not impregnated with it, as\n"
 "in the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " case of ordinary ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used,\n"
 "makes the hemp more pliable to the rope-maker, and also renders the\n"
 "rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use; yet,\n"
 "not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale-line\n"
 "for the close coiling to which it must be subjected; but as most\n"
 "seamen are beginning to learn, tar in general by no means adds to the\n"
 "rope's durability or strength, however much it may give it compactness\n"
 "and gloss.  Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery\n"
 "almost entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for,\n"
 "though not so durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and\n"
 "elastic; and I will add (since there is an aesthetics in all things),\n"
 "is much more handsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a\n"
 "dusky, dark fellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a\n"
 "golden-haired Circassian to behold.  The whale line is only two thirds\n"
 "of an inch in thickness. At first sight, you would not think it so\n"
 "strong as it really is. By experiment its one and fifty yarns will\n"
 "each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds; so that the\n"
 "whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons. In length,\n"
 "the common sperm whale-line measures something over two hundred\n"
 "fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in\n"
 "the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still though, but so as to form\n"
 "one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded \"sheaves,\" or layers\n"
 "of concentric spiralizations, without any hollow but the \"heart,\" or\n"
 "minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese. As the least\n"
 "tangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take\n"
 "somebody's arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used\n"
 "in stowing the line in its tub. Some harpooneers will consume almost\n"
 "an entire morning in this business, carrying the line high aloft and\n"
 "then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub, so as in\n"
 "the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists.\n"
 "In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line\n"
 "being continuously coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in\n"
 "this; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily\n"
 "into the boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American\n"
 "tub, nearly three feet in diameter and\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " of proportionate depth, makes a rather bulky freight for a\n"
 "craft whose planks are but one half-inch in thickness; for the bottom\n"
 "of the whale-boat is like critical ice, which will bear up a\n"
 "considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a concentrated\n"
 "one. When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the american\n"
 "line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious\n"
 "great wedding-cake to present to the whales.  Both ends of the line\n"
 "are exposed; the lower end terminating in an eye-splice or loop coming\n"
 "up from the bottom against the side of the tub, and hanging over its\n"
 "edge completely disengaged from everything. This arrangement of the\n"
 "lower end is necessary on two accounts. First: In order to facilitate\n"
 "the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat, in\n"
 "case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry\n"
 "off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon. In these\n"
 "instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale, as it\n"
 "were, from the one boat to the other; though the first boat always\n"
 "hovers at hand to assist its consort. Second: This arrangement is\n"
 "indispensable for common safety's sake; for were the lower end of the\n"
 "line in any way attached to the boat, and were the whale then to run\n"
 "the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking minute as he\n"
 "sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed boat would\n"
 "infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea;\n"
 "and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again.  Before\n"
 "lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is taken\n"
 "aft from the tub, and passing round the logger-head there, is again\n"
 "carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise upon\n"
 "the loom or handle of every man's oar, so that it jogs against his\n"
 "wrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as they alternately\n"
 "sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the\n"
 "extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the\n"
 "size of a common quill, prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks\n"
 "it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside\n"
 "the boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being\n"
 "coiled upon the box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale\n"
 "still a little further aft, and is then\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " attached to the short-warp - the rope which is immediately\n"
 "connected with the harpoon; but previous to that connexion, the\n"
 "short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail.\n"
 "Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,\n"
 "twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction. All the\n"
 "oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the timid\n"
 "eye of the landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the deadliest\n"
 "snakes sportively festooning their limbs.  Nor can any son of mortal\n"
 "woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies,\n"
 "and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any\n"
 "unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible\n"
 "contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus\n"
 "circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his\n"
 "bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly. Yet habit - strange thing!\n"
 "what cannot habit accomplish? - Gayer sallies, more merry mirth,\n"
 "better jokes, and brighter repartees, you never heard over your\n"
 "mahogany, than you will hear over the half-inch white cedar of the\n"
 "whale-boat, when thus hung in hangman's nooses; and, like the six\n"
 "burghers of Calais before King Edward, the six men composing the crew\n"
 "pull into the jaws of death, with a halter around every neck, as you\n"
 "may say.  Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account\n"
 "for those repeated whaling disasters - some few of which are casually\n"
 "chronicled - of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by\n"
 "the line, and lost. For, when the line is darting out, to be seated\n"
 "then in the boat, is like being seated in the midst of the manifold\n"
 "whizzings of a steam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, and\n"
 "shaft, and wheel, is grazing you. It is worse; for you cannot sit\n"
 "motionless in the heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking\n"
 "like a cradle, and you are pitched one way and the other, without the\n"
 "slightest warning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and\n"
 "simultaneousness of volition and action, can you escape being made a\n"
 "Mazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could\n"
 "never pierce you out.  Again: as the profound calm which only\n"
 "apparently precedes\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " and prophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the\n"
 "storm itself; for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of\n"
 "the storm; and contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle\n"
 "holds the fatal powder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the\n"
 "graceful repose of the line, as it silently serpentines about the\n"
 "oarsmen before being brought into actual play - this is a thing which\n"
 "carries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous\n"
 "affair. But why say more? All men live enveloped in whale-lines. All\n"
 "are born with halters round their necks; but it is only when caught in\n"
 "the swift, sudden turn of death, that mortals realize the silent,\n"
 "subtle, ever-present perils of life. And if you be a philosopher,\n"
 "though seated in the whale-boat, you would not at heart feel one whit\n"
 "more of terror, than though seated before your evening fire with a\n"
 "poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of\n"
 "portents, to Queequeg it was quite a different object.  \"When you see\n"
 "him 'quid\", said the savage, honing his harpoon in the bow of his\n"
 "hoisted boat, \"then you quick see him 'parm whale.\"  The next day was\n"
 "exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special to engage them,\n"
 "the Pequod's crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by\n"
 "such a vacant sea. For this part of the Indian Ocean through which we\n"
 "then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground; that is,\n"
 "it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins, flying-fish, and\n"
 "other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters, than those off the\n"
 "Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore ground off Peru.  It was my turn to\n"
 "stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders leaning against the\n"
 "slackened royal shrouds, to and\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " fro I idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air. No\n"
 "resolution could withstand it; in that dreamy mood losing all\n"
 "consciousness, at last my soul went out of my body; though my body\n"
 "still continued to sway as a pendulum will, long after the power which\n"
 "first moved it is withdrawn.  Ere forgetfulness altogether came over\n"
 "me, I had noticed that the seamen at the main and mizen mast-heads\n"
 "were already drowsy. So that at last all three of us lifelessly swung\n"
 "from the spars, and for every swing that we made there was a nod from\n"
 "below from the slumbering helmsman. The waves, too, nodded their\n"
 "indolent crests; and across the wide trance of the sea, east nodded to\n"
 "west, and the sun over all.  Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath\n"
 "my closed eyes; like vices my hands grasped the shrouds; some\n"
 "invisible, gracious agency preserved me; with a shock I came back to\n"
 "life. And lo! close under our lee, not forty fathoms off, a gigantic\n"
 "Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a\n"
 "frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian hue, glistening in\n"
 "the sun's rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating in the trough of\n"
 "the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet, the\n"
 "whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm\n"
 "afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last.  As if struck by\n"
 "some enchanter's wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at\n"
 "once started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from\n"
 "all parts of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from\n"
 "aloft, shouted forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and\n"
 "regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air.  \"Clear away the\n"
 "boats! Luff!\" cried Ahab. And obeying his own order, he dashed the\n"
 "helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.  The sudden\n"
 "exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and ere the\n"
 "boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the leeward,\n"
 "but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples as he\n"
 "swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed, Ahab\n"
 "gave orders that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak but\n"
 "in whispers. So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the\n"
 "boats,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " we swiftly but silently paddled along; the calm not admitting\n"
 "of the noiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus glided in\n"
 "chase, the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into\n"
 "the air, and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up.  \"There\n"
 "go flukes!\" was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by\n"
 "Stubb's producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite\n"
 "was granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the\n"
 "whale rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker's boat, and\n"
 "much nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the\n"
 "honor of the capture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at\n"
 "length become aware of his pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was\n"
 "therefore no longer of use. Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly\n"
 "into play. And still puffing at his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to\n"
 "the assault.  Yes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive\n"
 "to his jeopardy, he was going \"head out;\" that part obliquely\n"
 "projecting from the mad yeast which he brewed.  \"Start her, start her,\n"
 "my men! Don't hurry yourselves; take plenty of time - but start her;\n"
 "start her like thunder-claps, that's all,\" cried Stubb, spluttering\n"
 "out the smoke as he spoke. \"Start her, now; give 'em the long and\n"
 "strong stroke, tashtego. Start her, Tash, my boy - start her, all; but\n"
 "keep cool, keep cool - cucumbers is the word - easy, easy - only start\n"
 "her like grim death and grinning devils, and raise the buried dead\n"
 "perpendicular out of their graves, boys - that's all. Start her!\"\n"
 "\"Woo-hoo! Wa- hee!\" screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some old\n"
 "war- whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat\n"
 "involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke\n"
 "which the eager Indian gave.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " But his wild screams were answered by others quite as\n"
 "wild. \"Kee-hee! Kee-hee!\"  yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and\n"
 "backwards on his seat, like a pacing tiger in his cage.  \"Ka-la!\n"
 "Koo-loo!\" howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a mouthful of\n"
 "Grenadier's steak. And thus with oars and yells the keels cut the sea.\n"
 "Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the van, still encouraged his\n"
 "men to the onset, all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth. Like\n"
 "desperadoes they tugged and they strained, till the welcome cry was\n"
 "heard - \"Stand up, Tashtego!  - give it to him!\" The harpoon was\n"
 "hurled. \"Stern all!\" The oarsmen backed water; the same moment\n"
 "something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists. It was\n"
 "the magical line. An instant before, Stubb had swiftly caught two\n"
 "additional turns with it round the loggerhead, whence, by reason of\n"
 "its increased rapid circlings, a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and\n"
 "mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe. As the line passed round\n"
 "and round the loggerhead; so also, just before reaching that point, it\n"
 "blisteringly passed through and through both of Stubb's hands, from\n"
 "which the hand-cloths, or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at\n"
 "these times, had accidentally dropped. It was like holding an enemy's\n"
 "sharp two- edged sword by the blade, and that enemy all the time\n"
 "striving to wrest it out of your clutch.  \"Wet the line! wet the\n"
 "line!\" cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him seated by the tub) who,\n"
 "snatching off his hat, dashed the sea-water into it. More turns were\n"
 "taken, so that the line began holding its place. The boat now flew\n"
 "through the boiling water like a shark all fins. Stubb and Tashtego\n"
 "here changed places - stem for stern - a staggering business truly in\n"
 "that rocking commotion.  From the vibrating line extending the entire\n"
 "length of the upper part of the boat, and from its now being more\n"
 "tight than a harpstring, you would have thought the craft had two\n"
 "keels - one cleaving the water, the other the air - as the boat\n"
 "churned\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " on through both opposing elements at once. A continual\n"
 "cascade played at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake;\n"
 "and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a little finger,\n"
 "the vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into\n"
 "the sea. Thus they rushed; each man with might and main clinging to\n"
 "his seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam; and the tall form of\n"
 "Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double, in order to\n"
 "bring down his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed\n"
 "passed as they shot on their way, till at length the whale somewhat\n"
 "slackened his flight.  \"Haul in - haul in!\" cried Stubb to the\n"
 "bowsman! and, facing round towards the whale, all hands began pulling\n"
 "the boat up to him, while yet the boat was being towed on. Soon\n"
 "ranging up by his flank, Stubb, firmly planting his knee in the clumsy\n"
 "cleat, darted dart after dart into the flying fish; at the word of\n"
 "command, the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the whale's\n"
 "horrible wallow, and then ranging up for another fling.  The red tide\n"
 "now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill.  His\n"
 "tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which bubbled and\n"
 "seethed for furlongs behind in their wake. The slanting sun playing\n"
 "upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back its reflection into every\n"
 "face, so that they all glowed to each other like red men. And all the\n"
 "while, jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the\n"
 "spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of\n"
 "the excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his crooked\n"
 "lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb straightened it again and\n"
 "again, by a few rapid blows against the gunwale, then again and again\n"
 "sent it into the whale.  \"Pull up - pull up!\" he now cried to the\n"
 "bowsman, as the waning whale relaxed in his wrath. \"Pull up! - close\n"
 "to!\" and the boat ranged along the fish's flank.  When reaching far\n"
 "over the bow, Stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the fish,\n"
 "and kept it there, carefully churning and churning, as if cautiously\n"
 "seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have\n"
 "swallowed, and which he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it\n"
 "out. But that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of the\n"
 "fish. And now it is struck; for, starting\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his\n"
 "\"flurry,\" the monster horribly wallowed in his blood, over- wrapped\n"
 "himself in impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so that the imperilled\n"
 "craft, instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly to struggle out\n"
 "from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day.  And now\n"
 "abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into view;\n"
 "surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and contracting his\n"
 "spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations. At last, gush\n"
 "after gush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees of\n"
 "red wine, shot into the frighted air; and falling back again, ran\n"
 "dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea.  His heart had\n"
 "burst!  \"He's dead, Mr. Stubb,\" said Daggoo.  \"Yes; both pipes smoked\n"
 "out!\" and withdrawing his own from his mouth, Stubb scattered the dead\n"
 "ashes over the water; and, for a moment, stood thoughtfully eyeing the\n"
 "vast corpse he had made.  It will be seen in some other place of what\n"
 "a very light substance the entire interior of the Sperm Whale's\n"
 "enormous head consists. Though apparently the most massive, it is by\n"
 "far the most buoyant part about him. So that with ease he elevates it\n"
 "in the air, and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed.\n"
 "Besides, such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his\n"
 "head, and such the tapering cut-water formation of the lower part,\n"
 "that by obliquely elevating his head, he thereby may be said to\n"
 "transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a\n"
 "sharp-pointed New York pilot-boat. Partly to show the\n"
 "indispensableness of this act, it may here be stated, that, in the old\n"
 "Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the running line with water; in\n"
 "many other ships, a wooden piggin, or bailer, is set apart for that\n"
 "purpose. Your hat, however, is the most convenient.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " A word concerning an incident in the last chapter.  According\n"
 "to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat pushes off from\n"
 "the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary steersman,\n"
 "and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost oar, the one\n"
 "known as the harpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong, nervous arm to\n"
 "strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what is called a\n"
 "long dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of\n"
 "twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting the chase,\n"
 "the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost;\n"
 "indeed, he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the\n"
 "rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid\n"
 "exclamations; and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one's\n"
 "compass, while all the other\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " muscles are strained and half started - what that is none\n"
 "know but those who have tried it. For one, I cannot bawl very heartily\n"
 "and work very recklessly at one and the same time. In this straining,\n"
 "bawling state, then, with his back to the fish, all at once the\n"
 "exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry - \"Stand up, and give it\n"
 "to him!\" He now has to drop and secure his oar, turn round on his\n"
 "centre half way, seize his harpoon from the crotch, and with what\n"
 "little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into the\n"
 "whale. No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body, that\n"
 "out of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are successful; no\n"
 "wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated;\n"
 "no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood-vessels in the\n"
 "boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with\n"
 "four barrels; no wonder that to many ship owners, whaling is but a\n"
 "losing concern; for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage, and if\n"
 "you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it\n"
 "there when most wanted!\n"
 "\n"
 "Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant,\n"
 "that is, when the whale starts to run, the boat-header and harpooneer\n"
 "likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of\n"
 "themselves and every one else.  It is then they change places; and the\n"
 "headsman, the chief officer of the little craft, takes his proper\n"
 "station in the bows of the boat.  Now, I care not who maintains the\n"
 "contrary, but all this is both foolish and unnecessary. The headsman\n"
 "should stay in the bows from first to last; he should both dart the\n"
 "harpoon and the lance, and no rowing whatever should be expected of\n"
 "him, except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman. I know that\n"
 "this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase; but\n"
 "long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation has\n"
 "convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the fishery, it\n"
 "has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the before\n"
 "described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them.  To\n"
 "insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this\n"
 "world must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not from out\n"
 "of toil.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Out of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the\n"
 "twigs. So, in productive subjects, grow the chapters.  The crotch\n"
 "alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention. It is a\n"
 "notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length, which is\n"
 "perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow, for\n"
 "the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the\n"
 "harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the\n"
 "prow. Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who\n"
 "snatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his\n"
 "rifle from the wall. It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in\n"
 "the crotch, respectively called the first and second irons.\n"
 "\n"
 "But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with\n"
 "the line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one\n"
 "instantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the\n"
 "coming drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a\n"
 "hold. It is a doubling of the chances. But it very often happens that\n"
 "owing to the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale\n"
 "upon receiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the\n"
 "harpooneer, however lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the\n"
 "second iron into him. Nevertheless, as the second iron is already\n"
 "connected with the line, and the line is running, hence that weapon\n"
 "must, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow\n"
 "and somewhere; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all\n"
 "hands. Tumbled into the water, it accordingly is in such cases; the\n"
 "spare coils of box line (mentioned in a preceding chapter) making this\n"
 "feat, in most instances, prudently practicable.  But this critical act\n"
 "is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties.\n"
 "Furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown\n"
 "overboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " terror, skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale,\n"
 "entangling the lines, or cutting them, and making a prodigious\n"
 "sensation in all directions. Nor, in general, is it possible to secure\n"
 "it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse.  Consider,\n"
 "now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one\n"
 "unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these\n"
 "qualities in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of\n"
 "such an audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be\n"
 "simultaneously dangling about him. For, of course, each boat is\n"
 "supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first\n"
 "one be ineffectually darted without recovery. All these particulars\n"
 "are faithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to elucidate\n"
 "several most important, however intricate passages, in scenes\n"
 "hereafter to be painted.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Stubb's whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It\n"
 "was a calm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow\n"
 "business of towing the trophy to the Pequod. And now, as we eighteen\n"
 "men with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and\n"
 "fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish\n"
 "corpse in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at\n"
 "long intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness\n"
 "of the mass we moved. For, upon the great canal of Hang-Ho, or\n"
 "whatever they call it, in China, four or five laborers on the\n"
 "foot-path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an\n"
 "hour; but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if laden\n"
 "with pig-lead in bulk.  Darkness came on; but three lights up and down\n"
 "in the Pequod's main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer\n"
 "we saw Ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " bulwarks. Vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment, he\n"
 "issued the usual orders for securing it for the night, and then\n"
 "handing his lantern to a seaman, went his way into the cabin, and did\n"
 "not come forward again until morning.  Though, in overseeing the\n"
 "pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had evinced his customary\n"
 "activity, to call it so; yet now that the creature was dead, some\n"
 "vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or despair, seemed working in\n"
 "him; as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that Moby Dick was\n"
 "yet to be slain; and though a thousand other whales were brought to\n"
 "his ship, all that would not one jot advance his grand, monomaniac\n"
 "object. Very soon you would have thought from the sound on the\n"
 "Pequod's decks, that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the\n"
 "deep; for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck, and thrust\n"
 "rattling out of the port-holes. But by those clanking links, the vast\n"
 "corpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored. Tied by the head to the\n"
 "stern, and by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies with its black\n"
 "hull close to the vessel's, and seen through the darkness of the\n"
 "night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the two - ship and\n"
 "whale, seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one\n"
 "reclines while the other remains standing.  If moody Ahab was now all\n"
 "quiescence, at least so far as could be known on deck, Stubb, his\n"
 "second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an unusual but still\n"
 "good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was he in that the\n"
 "staid Starbuck, his\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " official superior, quietly resigned to him for the time the\n"
 "sole management of affairs. One small, helping cause of all this\n"
 "liveliness in Stubb, was soon made strangely manifest. Stubb was a\n"
 "high liver; he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a\n"
 "flavorish thing to his palate.  \"A steak, a steak, ere I sleep! You,\n"
 "Daggoo! overboard you go, and cut me one from his small!\"  Here be it\n"
 "known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a general thing,\n"
 "and according to the great military maxim, make the enemy defray the\n"
 "current expenses of the war (at least before realizing the proceeds of\n"
 "the voyage), yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers who\n"
 "have a genuine relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale\n"
 "designated by Stubb; comprising the tapering extremity of the body.\n"
 "About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two\n"
 "lanterns of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper\n"
 "at the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard. Nor was\n"
 "Stubb the only banqueter on whale's flesh that night. Mingling their\n"
 "mumblings with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks,\n"
 "swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its\n"
 "fatness. The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by\n"
 "the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull, within a few\n"
 "inches of the sleepers' hearts. Peering over the side you could just\n"
 "see them (as before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black\n"
 "waters, and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge\n"
 "globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head. This\n"
 "particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous. How, at such an\n"
 "apparently unassailable surface, they contrive to gouge out such\n"
 "symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the universal problem of all\n"
 "things.  The mark they thus leave on the whale, may best be likened to\n"
 "the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw.  Though\n"
 "amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks will\n"
 "be seen longingly gazing up to the ship's decks, like hungry dogs\n"
 "round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every\n"
 "killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while the valiant\n"
 "butchers over the deck-table are\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " thus cannibally carving each other's live meat with\n"
 "carving-knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks, also, with their\n"
 "jewel- hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away under the table\n"
 "at the dead meat; and though, were you to turn the whole affair upside\n"
 "down, it would still be pretty much the same thing, that is to say, a\n"
 "shocking sharkish business enough for all parties; and though sharks\n"
 "also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the\n"
 "Atlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be handy in case a\n"
 "parcel is to be carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be decently\n"
 "buried; and though one or two other like instances might be set down,\n"
 "touching the set terms, places, and occasions, when sharks do most\n"
 "socially congregate, and most hilariously feast; yet is there no\n"
 "conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless\n"
 "numbers, and in gayer or more jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm\n"
 "whale, moored by night to a whale-ship at sea. If you have never seen\n"
 "that sight, then suspend your decision about the propriety of\n"
 "devil-worship, and the expediency of conciliating the devil.  But, as\n"
 "yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was going on\n"
 "so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his own\n"
 "epicurean lips.\n"
 "\n"
 "\"Cook, cook! - where's that old Fleece?\" he cried at length, widening\n"
 "his legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his\n"
 "supper; and, at the same time darting his fork into the dish, as if\n"
 "stabbing with his lance; \"cook, you cook! - sail this way, cook!\"  The\n"
 "old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously routed\n"
 "from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came shambling\n"
 "along from his galley, for, like many old blacks, there was something\n"
 "the matter with his knee-pans, which he did not keep well scoured like\n"
 "his other pans; this old Fleece, as they called him, came shuffling\n"
 "and limping along, assisting his step with his tongs, which, after a\n"
 "clumsy fashion, were made of straightened iron hoops; this old Ebony\n"
 "floundered along, and in obedience to the word of command, came to a\n"
 "dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb's sideboard; when,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " with both hands folded before him, and resting on his\n"
 "two-legged cane, he bowed his arched back still further over, at the\n"
 "same time sideways inclining his head, so as to bring his best ear\n"
 "into play.  \"Cook,\" said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish\n"
 "morsel to his mouth, \"don't you think this steak is rather overdone?\n"
 "You've been beating this steak too much, cook; it's too tender. Don't\n"
 "I always say that to be good, a whale-steak must be tough? There are\n"
 "those sharks now over the side, don't you see they prefer it tough and\n"
 "rare? What a shindy they are kicking up! Cook, go and talk to 'em;\n"
 "tell 'em they are welcome to help themselves civilly, and in\n"
 "moderation, but they must keep quiet. Blast me, if I can hear my own\n"
 "voice. Away, cook, and deliver my message. Here, take this lantern,\"\n"
 "snatching one from his sideboard; \"now then, go and preach to 'em!\"\n"
 "Sullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the deck\n"
 "to the bulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light low over\n"
 "the sea, so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the other\n"
 "hand he solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the side\n"
 "in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks, while Stubb, softly\n"
 "crawling behind, overheard all that was said.  \"Fellow-critters: I'se\n"
 "ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam noise dare.  you hear?\n"
 "stop dat dam smackin' ob de lip! massa Stubb say dat you can fill your\n"
 "dam bellies up to de hatchings, but by Gor! you must stop dat dam\n"
 "racket!\"  \"Cook,\" here interposed Stubb, accompanying the word with a\n"
 "sudden slap on the shoulder, - \"Cook! why, damn your eyes, you mustn't\n"
 "swear that way when you're preaching. That's no way to convert\n"
 "sinners, Cook!\"  \"Who dat? Den preach to him yourself,\" sullenly\n"
 "turning to go.  \"No, Cook; go on, go on.\"  \"Well, den, Belubed fellow-\n"
 "critters: - \" \"Right!\" exclaimed Stubb, approvingly, \"coax 'em to it;\n"
 "try that,\" and Fleece continued.  \"Do you is all sharks, and by natur\n"
 "wery woracious, yet I\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " zay to you, fellow-critters, dat dat woraciousness - 'top dat\n"
 "dam slappin' ob de tail! How you tink to hear, 'spose you keep up such\n"
 "a dam slappin' and bitin' dare?\"  \"Cook,\" cried Stubb, collaring him,\n"
 "\"I wont have that swearing. Talk to 'em gentlemanly.\"  Once more the\n"
 "sermon proceeded.  \"Your woraciousness, fellow-critters, I don't blame\n"
 "ye so much for; dat is natur, and can't be helped; but to gobern dat\n"
 "wicked natur, dat is de pint. You is sharks, sartin; but if you gobern\n"
 "de shark in you, why den you be angel; for all angel is not'ing more\n"
 "dan de shark well goberned. Now, look here, bred'ren, just try wonst\n"
 "to be cibil, a helping yourselbs from dat whale. Don't be tearin' de\n"
 "blubber out your neighbour's mout, I say. Is not one shark dood right\n"
 "as toder to dat whale? And, by Gor, none on you has de right to dat\n"
 "whale; dat whale belong to some one else. I know some o' you has berry\n"
 "brig mout, brigger dan oders; but den de brig mouts sometimes has de\n"
 "small bellies; so dat de brigness ob de mout is not to swallar wid,\n"
 "but to bite off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks, dat can't get\n"
 "into de scrouge to help demselves.\"  \"Well done, old Fleece!\" cried\n"
 "Stubb, \"that's Christianity; go on.\"  \"No use goin' on; de dam\n"
 "willains will keep a scrougin' and slappin' each oder, Massa Stubb;\n"
 "dey don't hear one word; no use a- preachin' to such dam g'uttons as\n"
 "you call 'em, till dare bellies is full, and dare bellies is\n"
 "bottomless; and when dey do get em full, dey wont hear you den; for\n"
 "den dey sink in de sea, go fast to sleep on de coral, and can't hear\n"
 "not'ing at all, no more, for eber and eber.\"  \"Upon my soul, I am\n"
 "about of the same opinion; so give the benediction, Fleece, and I'll\n"
 "away to my supper.\"  Upon this, Fleece, holding both hands over the\n"
 "fishy mob, raised his shrill voice, and cried - \"Cussed\n"
 "fellow-critters! Kick up de damndest row as ever you can; fill your\n"
 "dam' bellies 'till dey bust - and den die.\"  \"Now, cook,\" said Stubb,\n"
 "resuming his supper at the capstan; \"Stand just where you stood\n"
 "before, there, over against me, and pay particular attention.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"All dention,\" said Fleece, again stooping over upon his\n"
 "tongs in the desired position.  \"Well,\" said Stubb, helping himself\n"
 "freely meanwhile; \"I shall now go back to the subject of this\n"
 "steak. In the first place, how old are you, cook?\"  \"What dat do wid\n"
 "de 'teak,\" said the old black, testily.  \"Silence! How old are you,\n"
 "cook?\"  \"'Bout ninety, dey say,\" he gloomily muttered.  \"And have you\n"
 "lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook, and don't know\n"
 "yet how to cook a whale-steak? rapidly bolting another mouthful at the\n"
 "last word, so that that morsel seemed a continuation of the\n"
 "question. Where were you born, cook?\"  \"'Hind de hatchway, in\n"
 "ferry-boat, goin' ober de Roanoke.\"  \"Born in a ferry-boat! That's\n"
 "queer, too. But I want to know what country you were born in, cook?\"\n"
 "\"Didn't I say de Roanoke country?\" he cried, sharply.  \"No, you\n"
 "didn't, cook; but I'll tell you what I'm coming to, cook. You must go\n"
 "home and be born over again; you don't know how to cook a whale-steak\n"
 "yet.\"  \"Bress my soul, if I cook noder one,\" he growled, angrily,\n"
 "turning round to depart.  \"Come back, cook; - here, hand me those\n"
 "tongs; - now take that bit of steak there, and tell me if you think\n"
 "that steak cooked as it should be? Take it, I say\" - holding the tongs\n"
 "towards him - \"take it, and taste it.\"  Faintly smacking his withered\n"
 "lips over it for a moment, the old negro muttered, \"Best cooked 'teak\n"
 "I eber taste; joosy, berry joosy.\"  \"Cook,\" said Stubb, squaring\n"
 "himself once more; \"do you belong to the church?\"  \"Passed one once in\n"
 "Cape-Down,\" said the old man sullenly.  \"And you have once in your\n"
 "life passed a holy church in Cape-Town, where you doubtless overheard\n"
 "a holy parson addressing his hearers as his beloved fellow-creatures,\n"
 "have you, cook! And yet you come here, and tell me such a dreadful lie\n"
 "as you did just now, eh?\" said Stubb. \"Where do you expect to go to,\n"
 "cook?\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"Go to bed berry soon,\" he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.\n"
 "\"Avast! heave to! I mean when you die, cook. It's an awful\n"
 "question. Now what's your answer?\"  \"When dis old brack man dies,\"\n"
 "said the negro slowly, changing his whole air and demeanor, \"he\n"
 "hisself won't go nowhere; but some bressed angel will come and fetch\n"
 "him.\"  \"Fetch him? How? In a coach and four, as they fetched Elijah?\n"
 "And fetch him where?\"  \"Up dere,\" said Fleece, holding his tongs\n"
 "straight over his head, and keeping it there very solemnly.  \"So,\n"
 "then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when you\n"
 "are dead? But don't you know the higher you climb, the colder it gets?\n"
 "Main-top, eh?\"  \"Didn't say dat t'all,\" said Fleece, again in the\n"
 "sulks.  \"You said up there, didn't you, and now look yourself, and see\n"
 "where your tongs are pointing. But, perhaps you expect to get into\n"
 "heaven by crawling through the lubber's hole, cook; but no, no, cook,\n"
 "you don't get there, except you go the regular way, round by the\n"
 "rigging. It's a ticklish business, but must be done, or else it's no\n"
 "go. But none of us are in heaven yet. Drop your tongs, cook, and hear\n"
 "my orders. Do ye hear? Hold your hat in one hand, and clap t'other\n"
 "a'top of your heart, when I'm giving my orders, cook. What! that your\n"
 "heart, there? - that's your gizzard! Aloft! aloft! - that's it - now\n"
 "you have it. Hold it there now, and pay attention.\"  \"All 'dention,\"\n"
 "said the old black, with both hands placed as desired, vainly\n"
 "wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears in front at one\n"
 "and the same time.  \"Well then, cook; you see this whale-steak of\n"
 "yours was so very bad, that I have put it out of sight as soon as\n"
 "possible; you see that, don't you? Well, for the future, when you cook\n"
 "another whale- steak for my private table here, the capstan, I'll tell\n"
 "you what to do so as not to spoil it by overdoing. Hold the steak in\n"
 "one hand, and show a live coal to it with the other; that done, dish\n"
 "it; d'ye hear? And now to-morrow, cook, when we are cutting in the\n"
 "fish, be sure you stand by to get the tips of his fins; have them put\n"
 "in pickle. As for the ends of the flukes, have them soused,\n"
 "cook. There, now ye may go.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " But Fleece had hardly got three paces off, when he was\n"
 "recalled.  \"Cook, give me cutlets for supper to- morrow night in the\n"
 "mid-watch. D'ye hear?  away you sail, then. - Halloa! stop! make a bow\n"
 "before you go. - Avast heaving again! Whale-balls for breakfast -\n"
 "don't forget.\"  \"Wish, by gor! whale eat him, 'stead of him eat\n"
 "whale. I'm bressed if he ain't more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself,\"\n"
 "muttered the old man, limping away; with which sage ejaculation he\n"
 "went to his hammock.  A little item may as well be related here. The\n"
 "strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale\n"
 "when moored alongside, is by the flukes or tail; and as from its\n"
 "greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other\n"
 "(excepting the side-fins), its flexibility even in death, causes it to\n"
 "sink low beneath the surface; so that with the hand you cannot get at\n"
 "it from the boat, in order to put the chain round it. But this\n"
 "difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a small, strong line is prepared\n"
 "with a wooden float at its outer end, and a weight in its middle,\n"
 "while the other end is secured to the ship. By adroit management the\n"
 "wooden float is to rise on the other side of the mass, so that now\n"
 "having girdled the made whale, the chain is readily made to follow\n"
 "suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last locked fast round\n"
 "the smallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with its broad\n"
 "flukes or lobes.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his\n"
 "lamp, and, like Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this\n"
 "seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the\n"
 "history and philosophy of it.  It is upon record, that three centuries\n"
 "ago the tongue of the Right Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in\n"
 "France, and commanded large prices there. Also, that in Henry VIIIth's\n"
 "time, a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for\n"
 "inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises,\n"
 "which, you remember, are a species of whale. Porpoises, indeed, are to\n"
 "this day considered fine eating. The meat is made into balls about the\n"
 "size of billiard balls, and being well seasoned and spiced might be\n"
 "taken for turtle-balls or veal balls. The old monks of Dunfermline\n"
 "were very fond of them. They had a great porpoise grant from the\n"
 "crown.  The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would\n"
 "by all hands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of\n"
 "him; but when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one\n"
 "hundred feet long, it takes away your appetite. Only the most\n"
 "unprejudiced of men like Stubb, nowadays partake of\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are not so fastidious. We\n"
 "all know how they live upon whales, and have rare old vintages of\n"
 "prime old train oil. Zogranda, one of their most famous doctors,\n"
 "recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly juicy\n"
 "and nourishing. And this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who long\n"
 "ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel - that\n"
 "these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of\n"
 "whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among\n"
 "the Dutch whalemen these scraps are called \"fritters;\" which, indeed,\n"
 "they greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something\n"
 "like old Amsterdam housewives' dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when\n"
 "fresh. They have such an eatable look that the most self-denying\n"
 "stranger can hardly keep his hands off.  But what further depreciates\n"
 "the whale as a civilized dish, is his exceeding richness. He is the\n"
 "great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be delicately good.  Look at his\n"
 "hump, which would be as fine eating as the buffalo's (which is\n"
 "esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid pyramid of fat. But\n"
 "the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that is; like the\n"
 "transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the third month\n"
 "of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for\n"
 "butter. Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into\n"
 "some other substance, and then partaking of it. In the long try\n"
 "watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their\n"
 "ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there\n"
 "awhile. Many a good supper have I thus made.  In the case of a small\n"
 "Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish. The casket of the\n"
 "skull is broken into with an axe, and the two plump, whitish lobes\n"
 "being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large puddings), they are\n"
 "then mixed with flour, and cooked into a most delectable mess, in\n"
 "flavor somewhat resembling calves' head, which is quite a dish among\n"
 "some epicures; and every one knows that some young bucks among the\n"
 "epicures, by continually dining upon calves' brains, by and by get to\n"
 "have a little brains of their own, so as to be able to tell a calf's\n"
 "head from their own heads; which, indeed, requires uncommon\n"
 "discrimination. And that is the reason why\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " a young buck with an intelligent looking calf's head before\n"
 "him, is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see. The head looks\n"
 "a sort of reproachfully at him, with an \"Et tu Brute!\" expression.  It\n"
 "is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous\n"
 "that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence; that\n"
 "appears to result, in some way, from the consideration before\n"
 "mentioned: i. e. that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the\n"
 "sea, and eat it too by its own light.  But no doubt the first man that\n"
 "ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer; perhaps he was hung;\n"
 "and if he had been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly would have\n"
 "been; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does. Go to the\n"
 "meat-market of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds\n"
 "staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds. Does not that sight\n"
 "take a tooth out of the cannibal's jaw? Cannibals? who is not a\n"
 "cannibal? I tell you it will be more tolerable for the Fejee that\n"
 "salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine;\n"
 "it will be more tolerable for that provident Fejee, I say, in the day\n"
 "of judgment, than for thee, civilized and enlightened gourmand, who\n"
 "nailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in\n"
 "thy pat�-de-foie-gras.  But Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light,\n"
 "does he? and that is adding insult to injury, is it? Look at your\n"
 "knife-handle, there, my civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off\n"
 "that roast beef, what is that handle made of? - what but the bones of\n"
 "the brother of the very ox you are eating? And what do you pick your\n"
 "teeth with, after devouring that fat goose? With a feather of the same\n"
 "fowl. And with what quill did the Secretary of the Society for the\n"
 "Suppression of Cruelty to Ganders formally indite his circulars? It is\n"
 "only within the last month or two that that society passed a\n"
 "resolution to patronize nothing but steel pens.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " When in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after\n"
 "long and weary toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as\n"
 "a general thing at least, customary to proceed at once to the business\n"
 "of cutting him in. For that business is an exceedingly laborious one;\n"
 "is not very soon completed; and requires all hands to set about\n"
 "it. Therefore, the common usage is to take in all sail; lash the helm\n"
 "a'lee; and then send every one below to his hammock till daylight,\n"
 "with the reservation that, until that time, anchor-watches shall be\n"
 "kept; that is, two and two for an hour, each couple, the crew in\n"
 "rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes well.  But\n"
 "sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan will not\n"
 "answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather round\n"
 "the moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a\n"
 "stretch, little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning. In\n"
 "most other parts of the ocean, however, where these fish do not so\n"
 "largely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably\n"
 "diminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades,\n"
 "a procedure notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems to\n"
 "tickle them into still greater activity. But it was not thus in the\n"
 "present case with the Pequod's sharks; though, to be sure, any man\n"
 "unaccustomed to such sights, to have looked over her side that night,\n"
 "would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese, and\n"
 "those sharks the maggots in it.  Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting the\n"
 "anchor- watch after his supper was concluded; and when, accordingly,\n"
 "Queequeg and a forecastle seaman came on deck, no small excitement was\n"
 "created among the sharks; for immediately suspending the cutting\n"
 "stages over the side, and lowering three lanterns, so that they cast\n"
 "long gleams of light over the turbid sea, these\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " two mariners, darting their long whaling-spades, kept up an\n"
 "incessant murdering of the sharks, by striking the keen steel deep\n"
 "into their skulls, seemingly their only vital part. But in the foamy\n"
 "confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts, the marksmen could not\n"
 "always hit their mark; and this brought about new revelations of the\n"
 "incredible ferocity of the foe. They viciously snapped, not only at\n"
 "each other's disembowelments, but like flexible bows, bent round, and\n"
 "bit their own; till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over\n"
 "again by the same mouth, to be oppositely voided by the gaping\n"
 "wound. Nor was this all. It was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and\n"
 "ghosts of these creatures. A sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality\n"
 "seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones, after what might be\n"
 "called the individual life had departed. Killed and hoisted on deck\n"
 "for the sake of his skin, one of these sharks almost took poor\n"
 "Queequeg's hand off, when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his\n"
 "murderous jaw.  \"Queequeg no care what god made him shark,\" said the\n"
 "savage, agonizingly lifting his hand up and down; \"wedder Fejee god or\n"
 "Nantucket god; but de god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin.\" The\n"
 "whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel; is\n"
 "about the bigness of a man's spread hand; and in general shape,\n"
 "corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named; only its\n"
 "sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably narrower than\n"
 "the lower. This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible; and when\n"
 "being used is occasionally honed, just like a razor. In its socket, a\n"
 "stiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long, is inserted for a handle.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " It was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed! Ex\n"
 "officio professors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen. The ivory\n"
 "Pequod was turned into what seemed a shamble;\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " every sailor a butcher. You would have thought we were\n"
 "offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods.  In the first\n"
 "place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous things\n"
 "comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green, and which no\n"
 "single man can possibly lift - this vast bunch of grapes was swayed up\n"
 "to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower mast-head, the\n"
 "strongest point anywhere above a ship's deck. The end of the\n"
 "hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies, was then conducted\n"
 "to the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung\n"
 "over the whale; to this block the great blubber hook, weighing some\n"
 "one hundred pounds, was attached. And now suspended in stages over the\n"
 "side, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with their long spades,\n"
 "began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just\n"
 "above the nearest of the two side-fins. This done, a broad,\n"
 "semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is inserted, and the\n"
 "main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now commence heaving\n"
 "in one dense crowd at the windlass. When instantly, the entire ship\n"
 "careens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like the nail-heads\n"
 "of an old house in frosty weather; she trembles, quivers, and nods her\n"
 "frighted mast-heads to the sky. More and more she leans over to the\n"
 "whale, while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a\n"
 "helping heave from the billows; till at last, a swift, startling snap\n"
 "is heard; with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from\n"
 "the whale, and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after\n"
 "it the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber. Now\n"
 "as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an\n"
 "orange, so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is\n"
 "sometimes stripped by spiralizing it. For the strain constantly kept\n"
 "up by the windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over\n"
 "in the water, and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off\n"
 "along the line called the \"scarf,\" simultaneously cut by the spades of\n"
 "Starbuck and Stubb, the mates; and just as fast as it is thus peeled\n"
 "off, and indeed by that very act itself, it is all the time being\n"
 "hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the\n"
 "main-top; the men at the windlass then cease heaving, and for a moment\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " or two the prodigious blood-dripping mass sways to and fro as\n"
 "if let down from the sky, and every one present must take good heed to\n"
 "dodge it when it swings, else it may box his ears and pitch him\n"
 "headlong overboard.  One of the attending harpooneers now advances\n"
 "with a long, keen weapon called a boarding-sword, and watching his\n"
 "chance he dexterously slices out a considerable hole in the lower part\n"
 "of the swaying mass. Into this hole, the end of the second alternating\n"
 "great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber,\n"
 "in order to prepare for what follows. Whereupon, this accomplished\n"
 "swordsman, warning all hands to stand off, once more makes a\n"
 "scientific dash at the mass, and with a few sidelong, desperate,\n"
 "lunging slicings, severs it completely in twain; so that while the\n"
 "short lower part is still fast, the long upper strip, called a\n"
 "blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for lowering. The\n"
 "heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is\n"
 "peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other is\n"
 "slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the main\n"
 "hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the\n"
 "blubber-room. Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep\n"
 "coiling away the long blanket- piece as if it were a great live mass\n"
 "of plaited serpents. And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles\n"
 "hoisting and lowering simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving,\n"
 "the heavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates\n"
 "scarfing, the ship straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by\n"
 "way of assuaging the general friction.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject,\n"
 "the skin of the whale. I have had controversies about it with\n"
 "experienced whalemen afloat, and learned naturalists ashore.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " My original opinion remains unchanged; but it is only an\n"
 "opinion.  The question is, what and where is the skin of the whale?\n"
 "Already you know what his blubber is. That blubber is something of the\n"
 "consistence of firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and\n"
 "compact, and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in\n"
 "thickness.  Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of\n"
 "any creature's skin as being of that sort of consistence and\n"
 "thickness, yet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a\n"
 "presumption; because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer\n"
 "from the whale's body but that same blubber; and the outermost\n"
 "enveloping layer of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be\n"
 "but the skin? True, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you may\n"
 "scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin, transparent substance,\n"
 "somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only it is\n"
 "almost as flexible and soft as satin; that is, previous to being\n"
 "dried, when it not only contracts and thickens, but becomes rather\n"
 "hard and brittle. I have several such dried bits, which I use for\n"
 "marks in my whale-books. It is transparent, as I said before; and\n"
 "being laid upon the printed page, I have sometimes pleased myself with\n"
 "fancying it exerted a magnifying influence. At any rate, it is\n"
 "pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles, as you may\n"
 "say. But what I am driving at here is this. That same infinitely thin,\n"
 "isinglass substance, which, I admit, invests the entire body of the\n"
 "whale, is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature, as\n"
 "the skin of the skin, so to speak; for it were simply ridiculous to\n"
 "say, that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more\n"
 "tender than the skin of a new-born child. But no more of this.\n"
 "Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this\n"
 "skin, as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk\n"
 "of one hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in\n"
 "quantity, or rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only\n"
 "three fourths, and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea may\n"
 "hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of\n"
 "whose mere\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " integument yields such a lake of liquid as that. Reckoning\n"
 "ten barrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of only\n"
 "three quarters of the stuff of the whale's skin.  In life, the visible\n"
 "surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the many marvels he\n"
 "presents. Almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and\n"
 "re-crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array, something\n"
 "like those in the finest Italian line engravings. But these marks do\n"
 "not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned,\n"
 "but seem to be seen through it, as if they were engraved upon the body\n"
 "itself. Nor is this all. In some instances, to the quick, observant\n"
 "eye, those linear marks, as in a veritable engraving, but afford the\n"
 "ground for far other delineations. These are hieroglyphical; that is,\n"
 "if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids\n"
 "hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to use in the present\n"
 "connexion. By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm\n"
 "Whale in particular, I was much struck with a plate representing the\n"
 "old Indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades\n"
 "on the banks of the Upper Mississippi. Like those mystic rocks, too,\n"
 "the mystic-marked whale remains undecipherable. This allusion to the\n"
 "Indian rocks reminds me of another thing.  Besides all the other\n"
 "phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents, he not\n"
 "seldom displays the back, and more especially his flanks, effaced in\n"
 "great part of the regular linear appearance, by reason of numerous\n"
 "rude scratches, altogether of an irregular, random aspect. I should\n"
 "say that those New England rocks on the sea-coast, which Agassiz\n"
 "imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact with vast\n"
 "floating icebergs - I should say, that those rocks must not a little\n"
 "resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular. It also seems to me that\n"
 "such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with\n"
 "other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large, full- grown\n"
 "bulls of the species.  A word or two more concerning this matter of\n"
 "the skin or blubber of the whale.  It has already been said, that it\n"
 "is stript from him in long pieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most\n"
 "sea-terms, this one is very happy and significant. For the whale is\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or\n"
 "counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho slipt over his head,\n"
 "and skirting his extremity. It is by reason of this cosy blanketing of\n"
 "his body, that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all\n"
 "weathers, in all seas, times, and tides. What would become of a\n"
 "Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy seas of the north, if\n"
 "unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True, other fish are found\n"
 "exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but these, be it\n"
 "observed, are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very bellies are\n"
 "refrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the lee of an\n"
 "iceberg, as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire;\n"
 "whereas, like man, the whale has lungs and warm blood.  Freeze his\n"
 "blood, and he dies. How wonderful is it then - except after\n"
 "explanation - that this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as\n"
 "indispensable as it is to man; how wonderful that he should be found\n"
 "at home, immersed to his lips for life in those Arctic waters! where,\n"
 "when seamen fall overboard, they are sometimes found, months\n"
 "afterwards, perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice,\n"
 "as a fly is found glued in amber. But more surprising is it to know,\n"
 "as has been proved by experiment, that the blood of a Polar whale is\n"
 "warmer than that of a Borneo negro in summer.  It does seem to me,\n"
 "that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong individual vitality,\n"
 "and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare virtue of interior\n"
 "spaciousness. Oh, man! admire and model thyself after the whale! Do\n"
 "thou, too, remain warm among ice. Do thou, too, live in this world\n"
 "without being of it. Be cool at the equator; keep thy blood fluid at\n"
 "the Pole. Like the great dome of St. Peter's, and like the great\n"
 "whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature of thine own.  But\n"
 "how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things! Of erections,\n"
 "how few are domed like St. Peter's! of creatures, how few vast as the\n"
 "whale!\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"Haul in the chains! Let the carcase go astern!\" The vast\n"
 "tackles have now done their duty. The peeled white body of the\n"
 "beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though changed in hue,\n"
 "it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk.  it is still\n"
 "colossal. slowly it floats more and more away, the water round it torn\n"
 "and splashed by the insatiate sharks, and the air above vexed with\n"
 "rapacious flights of screaming fowls, whose beaks are like so many\n"
 "insulting poniards in the whale. The vast white headless phantom\n"
 "floats further and further from the ship, and every rod that it so\n"
 "floats, what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls,\n"
 "augment the murderous din. For hours and hours from the almost\n"
 "stationary ship that hideous sight is seen. Beneath the unclouded and\n"
 "mild azure sky, upon the fair face of the pleasant sea, wafted by the\n"
 "joyous breezes, that great mass of death floats on and on, till lost\n"
 "in infinite perspectives.  There's a most doleful and most mocking\n"
 "funeral! The sea-vultures all in pious mourning, the air-sharks all\n"
 "punctiliously in black or speckled. In life but few of them would have\n"
 "helped the whale, I ween, if peradventure he had needed it; but upon\n"
 "the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce. Oh, horrible\n"
 "vultureism of earth! from which not the mightiest whale is free.  Nor\n"
 "is this the end. Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost survives\n"
 "and hovers over it to scare. Espied by some timid man-of-war or\n"
 "blundering discovery-vessel from afar, when the distance obscuring the\n"
 "swarming fowls, nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in\n"
 "the sun, and the white spray heaving high against it; straightway the\n"
 "whale's unharming corpse, with trembling fingers is set down in the\n"
 "log - shoals, rocks, and breakers hereabouts: beware! And for years\n"
 "afterwards,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " perhaps, ships shun the place; leaping over it as silly sheep\n"
 "leap over a vacuum, because their leader originally leaped there when\n"
 "a stick was held.  There's your law of precedents; there's your\n"
 "utility of traditions; there's the story of your obstinate survival of\n"
 "old beliefs never bottomed on the earth, and now not even hovering in\n"
 "the air! There's orthodoxy!  Thus, while in life the great whale's\n"
 "body may have been a real terror to his foes, in his death his ghost\n"
 "becomes a powerless panic to a world.  Are you a believer in ghosts,\n"
 "my friend? There are other ghosts than the Cock-Lane one, and far\n"
 "deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe in them.\n"

 " It should not have been omitted that previous to completely\n"
 "stripping the body of the Leviathan, he was beheaded. Now, the\n"
 "beheading of the Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon\n"

 "without reason.  Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly\n"
 "be called a neck; on the contrary, where his head and body seem to\n"
 "join, there, in that very place, is the thickest part of\n"
 "him. Remember, also, that the surgeon must operate from above, some\n"
 "eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subject, and that\n"
 "subject almost hidden in a discolored, rolling, and oftentimes\n"
 "tumultuous and bursting sea. Bear in mind, too, that under these\n"
 "untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh; and\n"
 "in that subterraneous manner, without so much as getting one single\n"
 "peep into the ever-contracting gash thus made, he must skilfully steer\n"
 "clear of all adjacent, interdicted parts, and exactly divide the spine\n"
 "at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull. Do you not\n"
 "marvel,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " then, at Stubb's boast, that he demanded but ten minutes to\n"
 "behead a Sperm Whale?  When first severed, the head is dropped astern\n"
 "and held there by a cable till the body is stripped. That done, if it\n"
 "belong to a small whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately\n"
 "disposed of. But, with a full grown Leviathan this is impossible; for\n"
 "the Sperm Whale's head embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk,\n"
 "and completely to suspend such a burden as that, even by the immense\n"
 "tackles of a whaler, this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing\n"
 "a Dutch barn in jewellers' scales.  The Pequod's whale being\n"
 "decapitated and the body stripped, the head was hoisted against the\n"
 "ship's side - about half way out of the sea, so that it might yet in\n"
 "great part be buoyed up by its native element. And there with the\n"
 "strained craft steeply leaning over to it, by reason of the enormous\n"
 "downward drag from the lower mast-head, and every yard-arm on that\n"
 "side projecting like a crane over the waves; there, that\n"
 "blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod's waist like the giant\n"
 "Holofernes's from the girdle of Judith.  When this last task was\n"
 "accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went below to their\n"
 "dinner. Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now deserted\n"
 "deck.  An intense copper calm, like a universal yellow lotus, was more\n"
 "and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea.  A\n"
 "short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone\n"
 "from his cabin. Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to\n"
 "gaze over the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took\n"
 "Stubb's long spade - still remaining there after the whale's\n"
 "decapitation - and striking it into the lower part of the half-\n"
 "suspended mass, placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm, and so\n"
 "stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.  It was a\n"
 "black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so intense a\n"
 "calm, it seemed the Sphynx's in the desert. \"Speak, thou vast and\n"
 "venerable head,\" muttered Ahab, \"which, though ungarnished with a\n"
 "beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak, mighty\n"
 "head, and tell us the secret thing that is in thee. Of all divers,\n"
 "thou hast dived the deepest.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " that head upon which the upper sun now gleams, has moved amid\n"
 "this world's foundations. Where unrecorded names and navies rust, and\n"
 "untold hopes and anchors rot; where in her murderous hold this frigate\n"
 "earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned; there, in\n"
 "that awful water-land, there was thy most familiar home. Thou hast\n"
 "been where bell or diver never went; hast slept by many a sailor's\n"
 "side, where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them\n"
 "down. Thou saw'st the locked lovers when leaping from their flaming\n"
 "ship; heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave; true to each\n"
 "other, when heaven seemed false to them. Thou saw'st the murdered mate\n"
 "when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck; for hours he fell into\n"
 "the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw; and his murderers still\n"
 "sailed on unharmed - while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring\n"
 "ship that would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched,\n"
 "longing arms. O head! thou hast seen enough to split the planets and\n"
 "make an infidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!\"  \"Sail\n"
 "ho!\" cried a triumphant voice from the main-masthead.  \"Aye? Well,\n"
 "now, that's cheering,\" cried Ahab, suddenly erecting himself, while\n"
 "whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow. \"That lively cry upon\n"
 "this deadly calm might almost convert a better man. - Where away?\"\n"
 "\"Three points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down her breeze\n"
 "to us!\"  \"Better and better, man. Would now St. Paul would come along\n"
 "that way, and to my breezelessness bring his breeze! O Nature, and O\n"
 "soul of man! how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies!\n"
 "not the smallest atom stirs or lives on matter, but has its cunning\n"
 "duplicate in mind.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Hand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came\n"
 "faster than the ship, and soon the Pequod began to rock.  By and by,\n"
 "through the glass the stranger's boats and manned mast-heads proved\n"
 "her a whale-ship. but as she was so far to windward, and shooting by,\n"
 "apparently making a passage to some other ground, the Pequod could not\n"
 "hope to reach her.  So the signal was set to see what response would\n"
 "be made.  Here be it said, that like the vessels of military marines,\n"
 "the ships of the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all\n"
 "which signals being collected in a book with the names of the\n"
 "respective vessels attached, every captain is provided with\n"
 "it. Thereby, the whale commanders are enabled to recognise each other\n"
 "upon the ocean, even at considerable distances, and with no small\n"
 "facility.  The Pequod's signal was at last responded to by the\n"
 "stranger's setting her own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam\n"
 "of Nantucket. Squaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under\n"
 "the Pequod's lee, and lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the\n"
 "side-ladder was being rigged by Starbuck's order to accommodate the\n"
 "visiting captain, the stranger in question waved his hand from his\n"
 "boat's stern in token of that proceeding being entirely\n"
 "unnecessary. It turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic\n"
 "on board, and that Mayhew, her captain, was fearful of infecting the\n"
 "Pequod's company. For, though himself and boat's crew remained\n"
 "untainted, and though his ship was half a rifle-shot off, and an\n"
 "incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between; yet\n"
 "conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land, he\n"
 "peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the Pequod.  But\n"
 "this did by no means prevent all communication. Preserving an interval\n"
 "of some few yards between itself and the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " ship, the Jeroboam's boat by the occasional use of its oars\n"
 "contrived to keep parallel to the Pequod, as she heavily forged\n"
 "through the sea (for by this time it blew very fresh), with her\n"
 "main-topsail aback; though, indeed, at times by the sudden onset of a\n"
 "large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed some way ahead; but would\n"
 "be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings again. Subject to\n"
 "this, and other the like interruptions now and then, a conversation\n"
 "was sustained between the two parties; but at intervals not without\n"
 "still another interruption of a very different sort.  Pulling an oar\n"
 "in the Jeroboam's boat, was a man of a singular appearance, even in\n"
 "that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up all\n"
 "totalities.  He was a small, short, youngish man, sprinkled all over\n"
 "his face with freckles, and wearing redundant yellow hair. A\n"
 "long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut tinge\n"
 "enveloped him; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his\n"
 "wrists. A deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.  So soon as\n"
 "this figure had been first descried, Stubb had exclaimed - \"That's he!\n"
 "that's he! the long-togged scaramouch the Town-Ho's company told us\n"
 "of!\"  Stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the Jeroboam, and\n"
 "a certain man among her crew, some time previous when the Pequod spoke\n"
 "the Town-Ho. According to this account and what was subsequently\n"
 "learned, it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a\n"
 "wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the Jeroboam. His story\n"
 "was this: He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of\n"
 "Neskyeuna Shakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their\n"
 "cracked, secret meetings having several times descended from heaven by\n"
 "the way of a trap-door, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh\n"
 "vial, which he carried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of\n"
 "containing gunpowder, was supposed to be charged with laudanum. A\n"
 "strange, apostolic whim having seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for\n"
 "Nantucket, where, with that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed\n"
 "a steady, common sense exterior and offered himself as a green-hand\n"
 "candidate for the Jeroboam's whaling voyage. They engaged him;\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " but straightway upon the ship's getting out of sight of land,\n"
 "his insanity broke out in a freshet. He announced himself as the\n"
 "archangel Gabriel, and commanded the captain to jump overboard. He\n"
 "published his manifesto, whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer\n"
 "of the isles of the sea and vicar-general of all Oceanica. The\n"
 "unflinching earnestness with which he declared these things; - the\n"
 "dark, daring play of his sleepless, excited imagination, and all the\n"
 "preternatural terrors of real delirium, united to invest this Gabriel\n"
 "in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew, with an atmosphere\n"
 "of sacredness.  Moreover, they were afraid of him. As such a man,\n"
 "however, was not of much practical use in the ship, especially as he\n"
 "refused to work except when he pleased, the incredulous captain would\n"
 "fain have been rid of him; but apprised that that individual's\n"
 "intention was to land him in the first convenient port, the archangel\n"
 "forthwith opened all his seals and vials - devoting the ship and all\n"
 "hands to unconditional perdition, in case this intention was carried\n"
 "out. So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew, that\n"
 "at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if Gabriel was\n"
 "sent from the ship, not a man of them would remain. He was therefore\n"
 "forced to relinquish his plan. Nor would they permit Gabriel to be any\n"
 "way maltreated, say or do what he would; so that it came to pass that\n"
 "Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship. The consequence of all\n"
 "this was, that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain\n"
 "and mates; and since the epidemic had broken out, he carried a higher\n"
 "hand than ever; declaring that the plague, as he called it, was at his\n"
 "sole command; nor should it be stayed but according to his good\n"
 "pleasure. The sailors, mostly poor devils, cringed, and some of them\n"
 "fawned before him; in obedience to his instructions, sometimes\n"
 "rendering him personal homage, as to a god. Such things may seem\n"
 "incredible; but, however wondrous, they are true. Nor is the history\n"
 "of fanatics half so striking in respect to the measureless\n"
 "self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his measureless power of\n"
 "deceiving and bedevilling so many others. But it is time to return to\n"
 "the Pequod.  \"I fear not thy epidemic, man,\" said Ahab from the\n"
 "bulwarks\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " to Captain Mayhew, who stood in the boat's stern; \"come on\n"
 "board.\"  But now Gabriel started to his feet.  \"Think, think of the\n"
 "fevers, yellow and bilious! Beware of the horrible plague!\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\"Gabriel, Gabriel!\" cried Captain Mayhew; \"thou must either - \" But\n"
 "that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its\n"
 "seethings drowned all speech.  \"Hast thou seen the White Whale?\"\n"
 "demanded Ahab, when the boat drifted back.  \"Think, think of thy\n"
 "whale- boat, stoven and sunk! Beware of the horrible tail!\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\"I tell thee again, Gabriel, that - \" But again the boat tore ahead as\n"
 "if dragged by fiends. Nothing was said for some moments, while a\n"
 "succession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those\n"
 "occasional caprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving\n"
 "it. Meantime, the hoisted sperm whale's head jogged about very\n"
 "violently, and Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more\n"
 "apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant.  When\n"
 "this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story concerning\n"
 "Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions from Gabriel,\n"
 "whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed leagued\n"
 "with him.  It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when\n"
 "upon speaking a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the\n"
 "existence of Moby Dick, and the havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in\n"
 "this intelligence, Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against\n"
 "attacking the white whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his\n"
 "gibbering insanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being\n"
 "than the Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible. But\n"
 "when, some year or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from\n"
 "the mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardor to encounter\n"
 "him; and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the\n"
 "opportunity, despite all the archangel's denunciations and\n"
 "forewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his\n"
 "boat. With them he pushed off; and, after\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " much weary pulling, and many perilous, unsuccessful onsets,\n"
 "he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast. Meantime, Gabriel,\n"
 "ascending to the main-royal mast-head, was tossing one arm in frantic\n"
 "gestures, and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the\n"
 "sacrilegious assailants of his divinity. Now, while Macey, the mate,\n"
 "was standing up in his boat's bow, and with all the reckless energy of\n"
 "his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale, and\n"
 "essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a broad white\n"
 "shadow rose from the sea; by its quick, fanning motion, temporarily\n"
 "taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen. Next instant, the\n"
 "luckless mate, so full of furious life, was smitten bodily into the\n"
 "air, and making a long arc in his descent, fell into the sea at the\n"
 "distance of about fifty yards. Not a chip of the boat was harmed, nor\n"
 "a hair of any oarsman's head; but the mate for ever sank.  It is well\n"
 "to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the Sperm-Whale\n"
 "Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any. Sometimes,\n"
 "nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated; oftener the\n"
 "boat's bow is knocked off, or the thigh- board, in which the headsman\n"
 "stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body. But strangest\n"
 "of all is the circumstance, that in more instances than one, when the\n"
 "body has been recovered, not a single mark of violence is discernible;\n"
 "the man being stark dead.  The whole calamity, with the falling form\n"
 "of Macey, was plainly descried from the ship. Raising a piercing\n"
 "shriek - \"The vial! the vial!\" Gabriel called off the terror-stricken\n"
 "crew from the further hunting of the whale. This terrible event\n"
 "clothed the archangel with added influence; because his credulous\n"
 "disciples believed that he had specifically fore- announced it,\n"
 "instead of only making a general prophecy, which any one might have\n"
 "done, and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the wide margin\n"
 "allowed. He became a nameless terror to the ship.  Mayhew having\n"
 "concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to him, that the\n"
 "stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended to\n"
 "hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which Ahab\n"
 "answered - \"Aye\".  Straightway, then, Gabriel once more started to his\n"
 "feet, glaring\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " upon the old man, and vehemently exclaimed, with downward\n"
 "pointed finger - \"Think, think of the blasphemer - dead, and down\n"
 "there! - beware of the blasphemer's end!\"  Ahab stolidly turned aside;\n"
 "then said to Mayhew, \"Captain, I have just bethought me of my\n"
 "letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy officers, if I mistake\n"
 "not. Starbuck, look over the bag.\"  Every whale-ship takes out a\n"
 "goodly number of letters for various ships, whose delivery to the\n"
 "persons to whom they may be addressed, depends upon the mere chance of\n"
 "encountering them in the four oceans. Thus, most letters never reach\n"
 "their mark; and many are only received after attaining an age of two\n"
 "or three years or more.  Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his\n"
 "hand. It was sorely tumbled, damp, and covered with a dull, spotted,\n"
 "green mould, in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the\n"
 "cabin. Of such a letter, Death himself might well have been the\n"
 "post-boy.  \"Can'st not read it?\" cried Ahab. \"Give it me, man. Aye,\n"
 "aye it's but a dim scrawl; - what's this?\" As he was studying it out,\n"
 "Starbuck took a long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly\n"
 "split the end, to insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to\n"
 "the boat, without its coming any closer to the ship.  Meantime, Ahab\n"
 "holding the letter, muttered, \"Mr. Har - yes, Mr. Harry - (a woman's\n"
 "pinny hand, - the man's wife, I'll wager) - Aye - Mr. Harry Macey,\n"
 "Ship Jeroboam; - why it's Macey, and he's dead!\"  \"Poor fellow! poor\n"
 "fellow! and from his wife,\" sighed Mayhew; \"but let me have it.\"\n"
 "\"Nay, keep it thyself,\" cried Gabriel to Ahab; \"thou art soon going\n"
 "that way\".  \"Curses throttle thee!\" yelled Ahab. \"Captain Mayhew,\n"
 "stand by now to receive it;\" and taking the fatal missive from\n"
 "Starbuck's hands, he caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it\n"
 "over towards the boat. But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly\n"
 "desisted from rowing; the boat drifted a little towards the ship's\n"
 "stern; so that, as if by magic, the letter suddenly ranged along with\n"
 "Gabriel's eager hand. He clutched it in an instant, seized the\n"
 "boat-knife, and impaling the letter on it, sent it thus loaded back\n"
 "into the ship. It fell at Ahab's feet. Then Gabriel\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars, and\n"
 "in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod.\n"
 "As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the\n"
 "jacket of the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to\n"
 "this wild affair.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " In the tumultuous business of cutting in and attending to a\n"
 "whale, there is much running backwards and forwards among the\n"
 "crew. Now hands are wanted here,and then again hands are wanted\n"
 "there. There is no staying in any one place; for at one and the same\n"
 "time everything has to be done everywhere. It is much the same with\n"
 "him who endeavors the description of the scene. We must now retrace\n"
 "our way a little. It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in\n"
 "the whale's back, the blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole\n"
 "there cut by the spades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and\n"
 "weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole? It was\n"
 "inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as\n"
 "harpooneer to descend upon the monster's back for the special purpose\n"
 "referred to. But in very many cases, circumstances require that the\n"
 "harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole flensing or\n"
 "stripping operation is concluded. The whale be it observed, lies\n"
 "almost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated\n"
 "upon. So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the\n"
 "poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the\n"
 "water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him. On the\n"
 "occasion in question. Queequeg figured in the Highland costume - a\n"
 "shirt and socks - in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to\n"
 "uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to observe him, as\n"
 "will presently be seen.  Being the savage's bowsman, that is, the\n"
 "person who pulled the bow-oar in his boat (the second one from\n"
 "forward), it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that\n"
 "hard- scrabble scramble upon the dead whale's back. You have seen\n"
 "Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by a long cord. Just so, from\n"
 "the ship's steep side, did I hold Queequeg down there in the sea, by\n"
 "what is technically called in the fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a\n"
 "strong strip of canvas belted round his waist.  It was a humorously\n"
 "perilous business for both of us. For, before we proceed further, it\n"
 "must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both ends; fast to\n"
 "Queequeg's broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow leather one. So\n"
 "that for better or for worse, we two, for the time, were wedded; and\n"
 "should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both usage and honor\n"
 "demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should drag me down to\n"
 "his wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature united us. Queequeg\n"
 "was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I any way get rid of\n"
 "the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed.  So strongly\n"
 "and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then, that while\n"
 "earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to perceive that\n"
 "my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two;\n"
 "that my free will had received a mortal wound; and that another's\n"
 "mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster\n"
 "and death. Therefore, I saw that here wa a sort of interregnum in\n"
 "Providence; for its even- handed equity never could have sanctioned so\n"
 "gross an injustice. and yet still further pondering - while I jerked\n"
 "him now and then from between the whale and the ship, which would\n"
 "threaten to jam him - still further pondering, I say, I saw that this\n"
 "situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that\n"
 "breathes; only, in most cases he, one way or other, has this Siamese\n"
 "connexion with a plurality of other mortals. If your banker breaks,\n"
 "you nap; if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills,\n"
 "you die. True, you may say that, by exceeding caution, you may\n"
 "possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of\n"
 "life. But handle Queequeg's monkey-rope heedfully as I would,\n"
 "sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near sliding\n"
 "overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I would I only\n"
 "had the management of it.  I have hinted that I would often jerk poor\n"
 "Queequeg from between the whale and the ship - where he would\n"
 "occasionally fall, from the incessant rolling and swaying of both. but\n"
 "this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to.  Unappalled\n"
 "by the massacre made upon them during the night, the sharks now\n"
 "freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began\n"
 "to flow from the carcase - the rabid creatures swarmed round it like\n"
 "bees in a beehive.  And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who\n"
 "often pushed them aside with his foundering feet. A thing altogether\n"
 "incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale,\n"
 "the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a\n"
 "man.  Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such\n"
 "a ravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to\n"
 "them. Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then\n"
 "jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what\n"
 "seemed a peculiarily ferocious shark - he was provided with still\n"
 "another protection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages,\n"
 "Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of\n"
 "keen whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they\n"
 "could reach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very\n"
 "disinterested and benevolent of them. They meant Queequeg's best\n"
 "happiness, I admit; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from\n"
 "the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden\n"
 "by the blood-muddied water, those indiscreet spades of theirs would\n"
 "come nearer to amputating a leg than a tail. But poor Queequeg, I\n"
 "suppose, straining and gasping there with that great iron hook - poor\n"
 "Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his Yojo, and gave up his life\n"
 "into the hands of his gods.  Well, well, my dear comrade and\n"
 "twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in and then slacked off the rope to\n"
 "every swell of the sea - what matters it, after all? are you not the\n"
 "precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world? That\n"
 "unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those sharks, your foes; those\n"
 "spades, your friends; and what between sharks and spades you are in a\n"
 "sad pickle and peril, poor lad.  But courage! there is good cheer in\n"
 "store for you, Queequeg. For now, as with blue lips and bloodshot eyes\n"
 "the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains and stands all\n"
 "dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side; the steward\n"
 "advances, and with a benevolent, consolatory glance hands him - what?\n"
 "Some hot Cognac? No! hands him, ye gods! hands him a cup of tepid\n"
 "ginger and water!  \"Ginger? Do I smell ginger?\" suspiciously asked\n"
 "Stubb, coming near. \" Yes, this must be ginger,\" peering into the as\n"
 "yet untasted cup. then standing as if incredulous for a while, he\n"
 "calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly saying, \"Ginger?\n"
 "ginger? and will you have the goodness to tell me, Mr.  Dough-Boy,\n"
 "where lies the virtue of ginger? Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel\n"
 "you use, Dough-Boy, to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal?\n"
 "Ginger! - what the devil is ginger? - sea-coal? fire- wood? - lucifer\n"
 "matches? - tinder? - gunpowder? - what the devil is ginger, I say,\n"
 "that you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg here?\"  \"There is some\n"
 "sneaking Temperance Society movement about this business,\" he suddenly\n"
 "added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just come from forward. \"Will\n"
 "you look at the kannakin sir; smell of it, if you please.\" Then\n"
 "watching the mate's countenance, he added: \"The steward, Mr. Starbuck,\n"
 "had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to Queequeg, there, this\n"
 "instant off the whale. Is the steward an apothecary, sir? and may I\n"
 "ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the\n"
 "life into a half-drowned man?\"  \"I trust now,\" said Starbuck, \"it is\n"
 "poor stuff enough.\"  \"Aye,aye, steward,\" cried Stuff, \"we'll teach you\n"
 "to drug a harpooneer; none of your apothecary's medicine here; you\n"
 "want to poison us, do ye? You have got our insurances on our lives and\n"
 "want to murder us all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?\"  \"It was not\n"
 "me,\" cried Dough-Boy, \"it was Aunt Charity that brought the ginger on\n"
 "board; and bade me never give the harpooneer any spirits, but only\n"
 "this ginger-jub - so she called it.\"  \"Ginger- jub! you gingerly\n"
 "rascal! take that! and run along with ye to the lockers, and get\n"
 "something better. I hope I do no wrong, Mr. Starbuck. It is the\n"
 "captain's orders - grog for the harpooneer on a whale.\"  \"Enough,\"\n"
 "replied Starbuck, \"only don't hit him again, but - \" \"Oh, I never hurt\n"
 "when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something of that sort; and\n"
 "this fellow's a weasel. What were you about saying, sir?\"  \"Only this;\n"
 "go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.\"  When Stubb\n"
 "reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a sort of\n"
 "tea-caddy in the other. The first contained strong spirits, and was\n"
 "handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity's gift, and that was\n"
 "freely given to the waves.  It must be borne in mind that all this\n"
 "time we have a Sperm Whale's prodigious head hanging to the Pequod's\n"
 "side. But we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can\n"
 "get a chance to attend to it. For the present other matters press, and\n"
 "the best we can do now for the head, is to pray heaven the tackles may\n"
 "hold.  Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had\n"
 "gradually drifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " yellow brit, gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right\n"
 "Whales, a species of the Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this\n"
 "particular time lurking anywhere near. And though all hands commonly\n"
 "disdained the capture of those inferior creatures; and though the\n"
 "Pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all, and though she\n"
 "had passed numbers of them near the Crozetts without lowering a boat;\n"
 "yet now that a Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and beheaded, to\n"
 "the surprise of all, the announcement was made that a Right Whale\n"
 "should be captured that day, if opportunity offered.  Nor was this\n"
 "long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two boats, Stubb's\n"
 "and Flask's, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further and further\n"
 "away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at the mast-\n"
 "head. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of\n"
 "tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one\n"
 "or both the boats must be fast. An interval passed and the boats were\n"
 "in plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by\n"
 "the towing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at\n"
 "first it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a\n"
 "maelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from\n"
 "view, as if diving under the keel. \"Cut, cut!\" was the cry from the\n"
 "ship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of\n"
 "being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel's side. But having\n"
 "plenty of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very\n"
 "rapidly, they paid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled\n"
 "with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes\n"
 "the struggle was intensely critical; for while they still slacked out\n"
 "the tightened line in one direction, and still plied their oars in\n"
 "another, the contending strain threatened to take them under. But it\n"
 "was only a few feet advance they sought to gain. And they stuck to it\n"
 "till they did gain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running\n"
 "like lightning along the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath\n"
 "the ship, suddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and\n"
 "quivering; and so flinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like\n"
 "bits of broken glass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to\n"
 "sight, and once more the boats were free\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " to fly. But the fagged whale abated his speed, and blindly\n"
 "altering his course, went round the stern of the ship towing the two\n"
 "boats after him, so that they performed a complete circuit.  Meantime,\n"
 "they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close flanking him on\n"
 "both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance; and thus round\n"
 "and round the Pequod the battle went, while the multitudes of sharks\n"
 "that had before swum round the Sperm Whale's body, rushed to the fresh\n"
 "blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every new gash, as the\n"
 "eager Israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from\n"
 "the smitten rock.  At last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful\n"
 "roll and vomit, he turned upon his back a corpse.  While the two\n"
 "headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes, and in other\n"
 "ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some conversation\n"
 "ensued between them.  \"I wonder what the old man wants with this lump\n"
 "of foul lard,\" said Stubb, not without some disgust at the thought of\n"
 "having to do with so ignoble a Leviathan.\n"
 "\n"
 "\"Wants with it?\" said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat's\n"
 "bow, \"did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm\n"
 "Whale's head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a\n"
 "Right Whale's on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that\n"
 "ship can never afterwards capsize?\"  \"Why not?\"  \"I don't know, but I\n"
 "heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so, and he seems to know\n"
 "all about ships' charms. But I sometimes think he'll charm the ship to\n"
 "no good at last. I don't half like that chap, Stubb. Did you ever\n"
 "notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake's head,\n"
 "Stubb?\"  \"Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a\n"
 "chance of a dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no\n"
 "one by; look down there, Flask\" - pointing into the sea with a\n"
 "peculiar motion of both hands - \"Aye, will I! Flask, I take that\n"
 "Fedallah to be the devil in disguise. Do you believe that cock and\n"
 "bull story about his having been stowed away on board ship? He's the\n"
 "devil, I say. The reason why you don't see his tail, is because he\n"
 "tucks it up out of sight; he carries it\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " coiled away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I\n"
 "think of it, he's always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his\n"
 "boots.\"  \"He sleeps in his boots, don't he? He hasn't got any hammock;\n"
 "but I've seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.\"  \"No doubt, and\n"
 "it's because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do ye see, in the\n"
 "eye of the rigging.\"  \"What's the old man have so much to do with him\n"
 "for?\"  \"Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.\"  \"Bargain? -\n"
 "about what?\"  \"Why, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that\n"
 "White Whale, and the devil there is trying to come round him, and get\n"
 "him to swap away his silver watch, or his soul, or something of that\n"
 "sort, and then he'll surrender Moby Dick.\"  \"Pooh! Stubb, you are\n"
 "skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?\"  \"I don't know, Flask, but the\n"
 "devil is a curious chap, and a wicked one, I tell ye. Why, they say as\n"
 "how he went a sauntering into the old flag-ship once, switching his\n"
 "tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old\n"
 "governor was at home. Well, he was at home, and asked the devil what\n"
 "he wanted. The devil, switching his hoofs, up and says, \"I want John.\"\n"
 "\"What for?\"  says the old governor, \"What business is that of yours,\"\n"
 "says the devil, getting mad, - \"I want to use him.\" \"Take him,\" says\n"
 "the governor - and by the Lord, Flask, if the devil didn't give John\n"
 "the Asiatic cholera before he got through with him, I'll eat this\n"
 "whale in one mouthful. But look sharp - aint you all ready there?\n"
 "Well, then, pull ahead, and let's get the whale alongside.\"  \"I think\n"
 "I remember some such story as you were telling,\" said Flask, when at\n"
 "last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the\n"
 "ship, \"but I can't remember where.\"  \"Three Spaniards? Adventures of\n"
 "those three bloody- minded soldadoes? Did ye read it there, Flask? I\n"
 "guess ye did? No; never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now,\n"
 "tell me, Stubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of\n"
 "just now, was the same you say is now on board the Pequod?\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"Am I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn't the\n"
 "devil live for ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you\n"
 "ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil\n"
 "has a latch-key to get into the admiral's cabin, don't you suppose he\n"
 "can crawl into a port-hole? Tell me that, Mr. Flask?\"  \"How old do you\n"
 "suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?\"  \"Do you see that mainmast there?\"\n"
 "pointing to the ship; \"well, that's the figure one; now take all the\n"
 "hoops in the Pequod's hold, and string 'em along in a row with that\n"
 "mast, for oughts, do you see; well, that wouldn't begin to be\n"
 "Fedallah's age. Nor all the coopers in creation couldn't show hoops\n"
 "enough to make oughts enough.\"  \"But see here, Stubb, I thought you a\n"
 "little boasted just now, that you meant to give Fedallah a sea- toss,\n"
 "if you got a good chance. Now, if he's so old as all those hoops of\n"
 "yours come to, and if he is going to live for ever, what good will it\n"
 "do to pitch him overboard - tell me that?\"  \"Give him a good ducking,\n"
 "anyhow.\"  \"But he'd crawl back.\"  \"Duck him again; and keep ducking\n"
 "him.\"  \"Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though -\n"
 "yes, and drown you - what then?\"  \"I should like to see him try it;\n"
 "I'd give him such a pair of black eyes that he wouldn't dare to show\n"
 "his face in the admiral's cabin again for a long while, let alone down\n"
 "in the orlop there, where he lives, and hereabouts on the upper decks\n"
 "where he sneaks so much. Damn the devil, Flask; do you suppose I'm\n"
 "afraid of the devil? Who's afraid of him, except the old governor who\n"
 "daresn't catch him and put him in double-darbies, as he deserves, but\n"
 "lets him go about kidnapping people; aye, and signed a bond with him,\n"
 "that all the people the devil kidnapped, he'd roast for him? There's a\n"
 "governor!\"  \"Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?\"\n"
 "\"Do I suppose it? You'll know it before long, Flask. But I am going\n"
 "now to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very\n"
 "suspicious going on, I'll just take him by the nape of his neck, and\n"
 "say - Look here, Beelzebub, you don't do\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord I'll make a grab\n"
 "into his pocket for his tail, take it to the capstan, and give him\n"
 "such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come short off at the\n"
 "stump - do you see; and then, I rather guess when he finds himself\n"
 "docked in that queer fashion, he'll sneak off without the poor\n"
 "satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.\"  \"And what will\n"
 "you do with the tail, Stubb?\"  \"Do with it? Sell it for an ox whip\n"
 "when we get home; - what else?\"  \"Now, do you mean what you say, and\n"
 "have been saying all along, Stubb?\"  \"Mean or not mean, here we are at\n"
 "the ship.\"  The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the\n"
 "larboard side, where fluke chains and other necessaries were already\n"
 "prepared for securing him.  \"Didn't I tell you so?\" said Flask; \"yes,\n"
 "you'll soon see this right whale's head hoisted up opposite that\n"
 "parmacetti's.\"  In good time, Flask's saying proved true. As before,\n"
 "the Pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale's head, now, by\n"
 "the counterpoise of both heads, she regained her even keel; though\n"
 "sorely strained, you may well believe. So, when on one side you hoist\n"
 "in Locke's head, you go over that way; but now, on the other side,\n"
 "hoist in Kant's and you come back again; but in very poor plight.\n"
 "Thus, some minds for ever keep trimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw\n"
 "all these thunder-heads overboard, and then you will float light and\n"
 "right.  In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought\n"
 "alongside the ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take\n"
 "place as in the case of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance,\n"
 "the head is cut off whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are\n"
 "separately removed and hoisted on deck, with all the well known black\n"
 "bone attached to what is called the crown-piece. But nothing like\n"
 "this, in the present case, had been done. The carcases of both whales\n"
 "had dropped astern; and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a\n"
 "mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers.  Meantime, Fedallah\n"
 "was calmly eyeing the right whale's head, and ever and anon glancing\n"
 "from the deep wrinkles there to the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " lines in his own hand. And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the\n"
 "Parsee occupied his shadow; while, if the Parsee's shadow was there at\n"
 "all it seemed only to blend with, and lengthen Ahab's. As the crew\n"
 "toiled on, Laplandish speculations were bandied among them, concerning\n"
 "all these passing things.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together;\n"
 "let us join them, and lay together our own.  Of the grand order of\n"
 "folio Leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale are by far the\n"
 "most noteworthy. They are the only whales regularly hunted by man. To\n"
 "the Nantucketer, they present the two extremes of all the known\n"
 "varieties of the whale. As the external difference between them is\n"
 "mainly observable in their heads; and as a head of each is this moment\n"
 "hanging from the Pequod's side; and as we may freely go from one to\n"
 "the other, by merely stepping across the deck: - where, I should like\n"
 "to know, will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology\n"
 "than here?  In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast\n"
 "between these heads.  Both are massive enough in all conscience; but\n"
 "there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale's which\n"
 "the Right Whale's sadly lacks. There is more character in the Sperm\n"
 "Whale's head. As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense\n"
 "superiority to him, in point of pervading dignity. In the present\n"
 "instance, too, this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt color\n"
 "of his head at the summit, giving token of advanced age and large\n"
 "experience. In short, he is what the fishermen technically call a\n"
 "\"grey-headed whale\".  Let us now note what is least dissimilar in\n"
 "these heads - namely, the two most important organs, the eye and the\n"
 "ear.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Far back on the side of the head, and low down, near the\n"
 "angle of either whale's jaw, if you narrowly search, you will at last\n"
 "see a lashless eye, which you would fancy to be a young colt's eye; so\n"
 "out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head.  Now, from\n"
 "this peculiar sideway position of the whale's eyes, it is plain that\n"
 "he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more than he can\n"
 "one exactly astern. in a word, the position of the whale's eyes\n"
 "corresponds to that of a man's ears; and you may fancy, for yourself,\n"
 "how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects through\n"
 "your ears. You would find that you could only command some thirty\n"
 "degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight; and\n"
 "about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking\n"
 "straight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not\n"
 "be able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from\n"
 "behind. In a word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the\n"
 "same time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for what is it that makes\n"
 "the front of a man - what, indeed, but his eyes?  Moreover, while in\n"
 "most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes are so planted as\n"
 "imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to produce one\n"
 "picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of the whale's\n"
 "eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid\n"
 "head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating two\n"
 "lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the\n"
 "impressions which each independent organ imparts. The whale,\n"
 "therefore, must see one distinct picture on this side, and another\n"
 "distinct picture on that side; while all between must be profound\n"
 "darkness and nothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look\n"
 "out on the world from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his\n"
 "window. But with the whale, these two sashes are separately inserted,\n"
 "making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing the view. This\n"
 "peculiarity of the whale's eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind\n"
 "in the fishery; and to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent\n"
 "scenes.  A curious and most puzzling question might be started\n"
 "concerning\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " this visual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be\n"
 "content with a hint.  so long as a man's eyes are open in the light,\n"
 "the act of seeing is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help\n"
 "mechanically seeing whatever objects are before him. Nevertheless, any\n"
 "one's experience will teach him, that though he can take in an\n"
 "undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance, it is quite impossible\n"
 "for him, attentively, and completely, to examine any two things -\n"
 "however large or however small - at one and the same instant of time;\n"
 "never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other. But if you\n"
 "now come to separate these two objects, and surround each by a circle\n"
 "of profound darkness; then, in order to see one of them, in such a\n"
 "manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other will be utterly\n"
 "excluded from your contemporary consciousness. How is it, then, with\n"
 "the whale? True, both his eyes, in themselves, must simultaneously\n"
 "act; but is his brain so much more comprehensive, combining, and\n"
 "subtle than man's, that he can at the same moment of time attentively\n"
 "examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of him, and the other\n"
 "in an exactly opposite direction? If he can, then is it as marvellous\n"
 "a thing in him, as if a man were able simultaneously to go through the\n"
 "demonstrations of two distinct problems in Euclid. Nor, strictly\n"
 "investigated, is there any incongruity in this comparison.  It may be\n"
 "but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the\n"
 "extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when\n"
 "beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer\n"
 "frights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly\n"
 "proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their\n"
 "divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them.\n"
 "But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an\n"
 "entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads for\n"
 "hours, and never discover that organ. The ear has no external leaf\n"
 "whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so\n"
 "wondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye. With\n"
 "respect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed\n"
 "between the sperm whale and the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " right. While the ear of the former has an external opening,\n"
 "that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a\n"
 "membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from without.  Is it not\n"
 "curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the world\n"
 "through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear which is\n"
 "smaller than a hare's? But if his eyes were broad as the lens of\n"
 "Herschel's great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of\n"
 "cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of\n"
 "hearing? Not at all. - Why then do you try to \"enlarge\" your mind?\n"
 "Subtilize it.  Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we\n"
 "have at hand, cant over the sperm whale's head, so that it may lie\n"
 "bottom up; then, ascending by a ladder to the summit, have a peep down\n"
 "the mouth; and were it not that the body is now completely separated\n"
 "from it, with a lantern we might descend into the great Kentucky\n"
 "Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But let us hold on here by this tooth,\n"
 "and look about us where we are. What a really beautiful and chaste-\n"
 "looking mouth!  from floor to ceiling, lined, or rather papered with a\n"
 "glistening white membrane, glossy as bridal satins.  But come out now,\n"
 "and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems like the long\n"
 "narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with a hinge at one end, instead\n"
 "of one side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead, and expose\n"
 "its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such, alas! it\n"
 "proves to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these spikes\n"
 "fall with impaling force. But far more terrible is it to behold, when\n"
 "fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there\n"
 "suspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging\n"
 "straight down at right-angles with his body, for all the world like a\n"
 "ship's jib-boom. This whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of\n"
 "sorts, perhaps; hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his\n"
 "jaw have relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a\n"
 "reproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws\n"
 "upon him.  In most cases this lower jaw - being easily unhinged by a\n"
 "practised artist - is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose\n"
 "of extracting the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " that hard white whalebone with which the fishermen fashion\n"
 "all sorts of curious articles, including canes, umbrella-stocks, and\n"
 "handles to riding-whips.  With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged\n"
 "on board, as if it were an anchor; and when the proper time comes -\n"
 "some few days after the other work - Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego,\n"
 "being all accomplished dentists, are set to drawing teeth.  With a\n"
 "keen cutting-spade, Queequeg lances the gums; then the jaw is lashed\n"
 "down to ringbolts, and a tackle being rigged from aloft, they drag out\n"
 "these teeth, as Michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild\n"
 "wood-lands. There are generally forty-two teeth in all; in old whales,\n"
 "much worn down, but undecayed; nor filled after our artificial\n"
 "fashion. The jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs, and piled away like\n"
 "joists for building houses.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the\n"
 "Right Whale's head.  As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale's head\n"
 "may be compared to a Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it\n"
 "is so broadly rounded); so, at a broad view, the Right Whale's head\n"
 "bears a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed\n"
 "shoe. Two hundred years ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to\n"
 "that of a shoemaker's last. And in this same last or shoe, that old\n"
 "woman of the nursery tale, with the swarming brood, might very\n"
 "comfortably be lodged, she and all her progeny.  But as you come\n"
 "nearer to this great head it begins to assume different aspects,\n"
 "according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit and look\n"
 "at these two f-shaped spout-holes, you would take the whole head for\n"
 "an enormous bass-viol, and these\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " spiracles, the apertures in its sounding-board. Then, again,\n"
 "if you fix your eye upon this strange, crested, comb-like incrustation\n"
 "on the top of the mass - this green, barnacled thing, which the\n"
 "Greenlanders call the \"crown,\" and the Southern fishers the \"bonnet\"\n"
 "of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes solely on this, you would take\n"
 "the head for the trunk of some huge oak, with a bird's nest in its\n"
 "crotch. At any rate, when you watch those live crabs that nestle here\n"
 "on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you;\n"
 "unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the technical term\n"
 "\"crown\" also bestowed upon it; in which case you will take great\n"
 "interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed\n"
 "king of the sea, whose green crown has been put together for him in\n"
 "this marvellous manner. But if this whale be a king, he is a very\n"
 "sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem. Look at that hanging lower\n"
 "lip! what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by\n"
 "carpenter's measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a\n"
 "sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.  A\n"
 "great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be\n"
 "hare-lipped. The fissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother\n"
 "during an important interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when\n"
 "earthquakes caused the beach to gape.  Over this lip, as over a\n"
 "slippery threshold, we now slide into the mouth. Upon my word were I\n"
 "at Mackinaw, I should take this to be the inside of an Indian\n"
 "wigwam. Good Lord! is this the road that Jonah went? The roof is about\n"
 "twelve feet high, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there were a\n"
 "regular ridge-pole there; while these ribbed, arched, hairy sides,\n"
 "present us with those wondrous, half vertical, scimetar-shaped slats\n"
 "of whale-bone, say three hundred on a side, which depending from the\n"
 "upper part of the head or crown bone, form those Venetian blinds which\n"
 "have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned. The edges of these bones are\n"
 "fringed with hairy fibres, through which the Right Whale strains the\n"
 "water, and in whose intricacies he retains the small fish, when\n"
 "open-mouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time. In the\n"
 "central blinds of bone, as they stand in their natural order, there\n"
 "are certain curious marks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some\n"
 "whalemen calculate\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the creature's age, as the age of an oak by its circular\n"
 "rings. Though the certainty of this criterion is far from\n"
 "demonstrable, yet it has the savor of analogical probability. At any\n"
 "rate, if we yield to it, we must grant a far greater age to the Right\n"
 "Whale than at first glance will seem reasonable.  In old times, there\n"
 "seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies concerning these\n"
 "blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous \"whiskers\"\n"
 "inside of the whale's mouth; another, \"hogs' bristles;\" a third old\n"
 "gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language: \"There are\n"
 "about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his upper\n"
 "chop, which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth.\"  As every\n"
 "one knows, these same \"hogs' bristles\", \"fins\", \"whiskers\", \"blinds\",\n"
 "or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and other\n"
 "stiffening contrivances. But in this particular, the demand has long\n"
 "been on the decline.  It was in Queen Anne's time that the bone was in\n"
 "its glory, the farthingale being then all the fashion. And as those\n"
 "ancient dames moved about gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as\n"
 "you may say; even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do\n"
 "we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection; the umbrella being\n"
 "a tent spread over the same bone.  But now forget all about blinds and\n"
 "whiskers for a moment, and, standing in the Right Whale's mouth, look\n"
 "around you afresh. Seeing all these colonnades of bone so methodically\n"
 "ranged about, would you not think you were inside the great Haarlem\n"
 "organ, and gazing upon its thousand pipes? For a carpet to the organ\n"
 "we have a rug of the softest Turkey - the tongue, which is glued, as\n"
 "it were, to the floor of the mouth. It is very fat and tender, and apt\n"
 "to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck. This particular tongue now\n"
 "before us; at a passing glance I should say it was a six-barreler;\n"
 "that is, it will yield you about that amount of oil.  Ere this, you\n"
 "must have plainly seen the truth of what I\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " started with - that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have\n"
 "almost entirely different heads. To sum up, then; in the Right Whale's\n"
 "there is no great well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long,\n"
 "slender mandible of a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale's. Nor in the\n"
 "Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip;\n"
 "and scarcely anything of a tongue. Again, the Right Whale has two\n"
 "external spout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.  Look your last, now,\n"
 "on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet lie together; for one\n"
 "will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other will not be very\n"
 "long in following.  Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale's\n"
 "there? It is the same he died with, only some of the longer wrinkles\n"
 "in the forehead seem now faded away. I think his broad brow to be full\n"
 "of a prairie-like placidity, born of a speculative indifference as to\n"
 "death. But mark the other head's expression. See that amazing lower\n"
 "lip, pressed by accident against the vessel's side, so as firmly to\n"
 "embrace the jaw. Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous\n"
 "practical resolution in facing death? This Right Whale I take to have\n"
 "been a Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might have taken up\n"
 "Spinoza in his latter years. This reminds us that the Right Whale\n"
 "really has a sort of whisker, or rather a moustache, consisting of a\n"
 "few scattered white hairs on the upper part of the outer end of the\n"
 "lower jaw. Sometimes these tufts impart a rather brigandish expression\n"
 "to his otherwise solemn countenance.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Ere quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale's head, I would\n"
 "have you, as a sensible physiologist, simply - particularly remark its\n"
 "front aspect, in all its compacted collectedness. I would have you\n"
 "investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some\n"
 "unexaggerated, intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power\n"
 "may be lodged there. Here is a vital point; for you must either\n"
 "satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself, or for ever remain an\n"
 "infidel as to one of the most appalling,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " but not the less true events, perhaps anywhere to be found in\n"
 "all recorded history.  You observe that in the ordinary swimming\n"
 "position of the Sperm Whale, the front of his head presents an almost\n"
 "wholly vertical plane to the water; you observe that the lower part of\n"
 "that front slopes considerably backwards, so as to furnish more of a\n"
 "retreat for the long socket which receives the boom-like lower jaw;\n"
 "you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head, much in the\n"
 "same way, indeed, as though your own mouth were entirely under your\n"
 "chin. Moreover you observe that the whale has no external nose; and\n"
 "that what nose he has - his spout hole - is on the top of his head;\n"
 "you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his head,\n"
 "nearly one third of his entire length from the front.  Wherefore, you\n"
 "must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm Whale's head is a\n"
 "dead, blind wall, without a single organ or tender prominence of any\n"
 "sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are now to consider that only in the\n"
 "extreme, lower, backward sloping part of the front of the head, is\n"
 "there the slightest vestige of bone; and not till you get near twenty\n"
 "feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development. So\n"
 "that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad. Finally, though,\n"
 "as will soon be revealed, its contents partly comprise the most\n"
 "delicate oil; yet, you are now to be apprised of the nature of the\n"
 "substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent\n"
 "effeminacy. In some previous place I have described to you how the\n"
 "blubber wraps the body of the whale, as the rind wraps an orange. Just\n"
 "so with the head; but with this difference: about the head this\n"
 "envelope, though not so thick, is of a boneless toughness, inestimable\n"
 "by any man who has not handled it. The severest pointed harpoon, the\n"
 "sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm, impotently rebounds\n"
 "from it. It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved\n"
 "with horses' hoofs. I do not think that any sensation lurks in it.\n"
 "Bethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded\n"
 "Indiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks,\n"
 "what do the sailors do? They do not suspend between them, at the point\n"
 "of coming contact, any merely hard substance,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " like iron or wood. No, they hold there a large, round wad of\n"
 "tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox-hide. That\n"
 "bravely and uninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their\n"
 "oaken handspikes and iron crowbars. By itself this sufficiently\n"
 "illustrates the obvious fact I drive at.  But supplementary to this,\n"
 "it has hypothetically occurred to me, that as ordinary fish possess\n"
 "what is called a swimming bladder in them, capable, at will, of\n"
 "distension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale, as far as I know,\n"
 "has no such provision in him; considering, too, the otherwise\n"
 "inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether\n"
 "beneath the surface, and anon swims with it high elevated out of the\n"
 "water; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelop;\n"
 "considering the unique interior of his head; it has hypothetically\n"
 "occurred to me, I say, that those mystical lung-celled honeycombs\n"
 "there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected\n"
 "connexion with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to atmospheric\n"
 "distension and contraction. If this be so, fancy the irresistibleness\n"
 "of that might, to which the most impalpable and destructive of all\n"
 "elements contributes.  Now, mark. Unerringly impelling this dead,\n"
 "impregnable, uninjurable wall, and this most buoyant thing within;\n"
 "there swims behind it all a mass of tremendous life, only to be\n"
 "adequately estimated as piled wood is - by the cord; and all obedient\n"
 "to one volition, as the smallest insect. So that when I shall\n"
 "hereafter detail to you all the specialities and concentrations of\n"
 "potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster; when I shall\n"
 "show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feats; I trust you\n"
 "will have renounced all ignorant incredulity, and be ready to abide by\n"
 "this; that though the Sperm Whale stove a passage through the Isthmus\n"
 "of Darien, and mixed the Atlantic with the Pacific, you would not\n"
 "elevate one hair of your eye-brow. For unless you own the whale, you\n"
 "are but a provincial and sentimentalist in Truth. But clear Truth is a\n"
 "thing for salamander giants only to encounter; how small the chances\n"
 "for the provincials then? What befel the weakling youth lifting the\n"
 "dread goddess's veil at Sais?\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Now comes the Baling of the Case. But to comprehend it\n"
 "aright, you must know something of the curious internal structure of\n"
 "the thing operated upon.  Regarding the Sperm Whale's head as a solid\n"
 "oblong, you may, on an inclined plane, sideways divide it into two\n"
 "quoins, whereof the lower is the bony structure, forming the cranium\n"
 "and jaws, and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its\n"
 "broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of\n"
 "the whale. At the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this\n"
 "upper quoin, and then you have two almost equal parts, which before\n"
 "were naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous\n"
 "substance.  The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense\n"
 "honeycomb of oil, formed by the crossing and re-crossing, into ten\n"
 "thousand infiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout\n"
 "its whole extent. The upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded\n"
 "as the great Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as that famous\n"
 "great tierce is mystically carved in front, so the whale's vast\n"
 "plaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the\n"
 "emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun. Moreover, as that of\n"
 "Heidelburgh was always replenished with the most excellent of the\n"
 "wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun of the whale contains by far\n"
 "the most precious of all his oily vintages; namely, the highly-prized\n"
 "spermaceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid, and odoriferous state. Nor\n"
 "is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the\n"
 "creature. Though in life it remains perfectly fluid, yet, upon\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " exposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to concrete;\n"
 "sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when the first thin\n"
 "delicate ice is just forming in water. A large whale's case generally\n"
 "yields about five hundred gallons of sperm, though from unavoidable\n"
 "circumstances, considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and dribbles\n"
 "away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of\n"
 "securing what you can.  I know not with what fine and costly material\n"
 "the heidelburgh Tun was coated within, but in superlative richness\n"
 "that coating could not possibly have compared with the silken\n"
 "pearl-colored membrane, like the line of a fine pelisse, forming the\n"
 "inner surface of the Sperm Whale's case.  It will have been seen that\n"
 "the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale embraces the entire length of\n"
 "the entire top of the head; and since - as has been elsewhere set\n"
 "forth - the head embraces one third of the whole length of the\n"
 "creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet for a good\n"
 "sized whale, you have more than twenty-six feet for the depth of the\n"
 "tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship's side.\n"
 "As in decapitating the whale, the operator's instrument is brought\n"
 "close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the\n"
 "spermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest\n"
 "a careless, untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly\n"
 "let out its invaluable contents. It is this decapitated end of the\n"
 "head, also, which is at last elevated out of the water, and retained\n"
 "in that position by the enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen\n"
 "combinations, on one side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in that\n"
 "quarter.  Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that\n"
 "marvellous and - in this particular instance - almost fatal operation\n"
 "whereby the Sperm Whale's great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped. Quoin is\n"
 "not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical mathematics. I\n"
 "know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a solid which\n"
 "differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep\n"
 "inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both sides.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering\n"
 "his erect posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging\n"
 "main-yard-arm, to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted\n"
 "Tun. He has carried with him a light tackle called a whip, consisting\n"
 "of only two parts, travelling through a single-sheaved block. Securing\n"
 "this block, so that it hangs down from the yard- arm, he swings one\n"
 "end of the rope, till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on\n"
 "deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down the other part, the Indian drops\n"
 "through the air, till dexterously he lands on the summit of the\n"
 "head. There - still high elevated above the rest of the company, to\n"
 "whom he vivaciously cries - he seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the\n"
 "good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A short-handled sharp\n"
 "spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches for the proper\n"
 "place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business he proceeds\n"
 "very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house, sounding the\n"
 "walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time this cautious\n"
 "search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like a\n"
 "well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the other\n"
 "end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or three\n"
 "alert hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the\n"
 "Indian, to whom another person has reached up a very long\n"
 "pole. Inserting this pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides\n"
 "the bucket into the Tun, till it entirely disappears; then giving the\n"
 "word to the seamen at the whip, up comes the bucket again, all\n"
 "bubbling like a dairy-maid's pail of new milk. Carefully lowered from\n"
 "its height, the full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand,\n"
 "and quickly emptied into a large tub. Then re- mounting aloft, it\n"
 "again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no\n"
 "more. Towards the end, Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " harder, and deeper and deeper into the Tun, until some twenty\n"
 "feet of the pole have gone down.  Now, the people of the Pequod had\n"
 "been baling some time in this way; several tubs had been filled with\n"
 "the fragrant sperm; when all at once a queer accident\n"
 "happened. Whether it was that Tashtego, that wild Indian, was so\n"
 "heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his one-handed hold on\n"
 "the great cabled tackles suspending the head; or whether the place\n"
 "where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or whether the Evil One\n"
 "himself would have it to fall out so, without stating his particular\n"
 "reasons; how it was exactly, there is no telling now; but, on a\n"
 "sudden, as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up - my\n"
 "God! poor Tashtego - like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable\n"
 "well, dropped head- foremost down into this great Tun of Heidelburgh,\n"
 "and with a horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of sight!  \"Man\n"
 "overboard!\" cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation first\n"
 "came to his senses. \"Swing the bucket this way!\" and putting one foot\n"
 "into it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip\n"
 "itself, the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head, almost\n"
 "before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom. Meantime,\n"
 "there was a terrible tumult. Looking over the side, they saw the\n"
 "before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of\n"
 "the sea, as if that moment seized with some momentous idea; whereas it\n"
 "was only the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles\n"
 "the perilous depth to which he had sunk.  At this instant, while\n"
 "Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing the whip - which had\n"
 "somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles - a sharp cracking noise\n"
 "was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all, one of the two\n"
 "enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with a vast vibration\n"
 "the enormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship reeled and shook\n"
 "as if smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook, upon which the\n"
 "entire strain now depended, seemed every instant to be on the point of\n"
 "giving way; an event still more likely from the violent motions of the\n"
 "head.  \"Come down, come down!\" yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " with one hand holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the\n"
 "head should drop, he would still remain suspended; the negro having\n"
 "cleared the foul line, rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed\n"
 "well, meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it, and so be\n"
 "hoisted out.  \"In heaven's name, man,\" cried Stubb, \"are you ramming\n"
 "home a cartridge there? - Avast! How will that help him; jamming that\n"
 "iron-bound bucket on top of his head? Avast, will ye!\"  \"Stand clear\n"
 "of the tackle!\" cried a voice like the bursting of a rocket.  Almost\n"
 "in the same instant, with a thunder- boom, the enormous mass dropped\n"
 "into the sea, like Niagara's Table-Rock into the whirlpool; the\n"
 "suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering\n"
 "copper; and all caught their breath, as half swinging - now over the\n"
 "sailors' heads, and now over the water - Daggoo, through a thick mist\n"
 "of spray, was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles, while\n"
 "poor, buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of\n"
 "the sea! But hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away, when a naked\n"
 "figure with a boarding-sword in its hand, was for one swift moment\n"
 "seen hovering over the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced\n"
 "that my brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue. One packed rush was\n"
 "made to the side, and every eye counted every ripple, as moment\n"
 "followed moment, and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could\n"
 "be seen. Some hands now jumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a\n"
 "little off from the ship.  \"Ha! ha!\" cried Daggoo, all at once, from\n"
 "his now quiet, swinging perch overhead; and looking further off from\n"
 "the side, we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves; a sight\n"
 "strange to see, as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave.\n"
 "\"Both! both! - it is both! - \".cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout;\n"
 "and soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand,\n"
 "and with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into\n"
 "the waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego\n"
 "was long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving\n"
 "after the slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had\n"
 "made side lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there;\n"
 "then dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and\n"
 "upwards, and so hauled out our poor Tash by the head. He averred, that\n"
 "upon first thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well knowing\n"
 "that that was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great trouble;\n"
 "- he had thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had\n"
 "wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next trial, he\n"
 "came forth in the good old way - head foremost. As for the great head\n"
 "itself, that was doing as well as could be expected.  And thus,\n"
 "through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of Queequeg, the\n"
 "deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was successfully\n"
 "accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and apparently\n"
 "hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be\n"
 "forgotten. Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing\n"
 "and boxing, riding and rowing.  I know that this queer adventure of\n"
 "the Gay-Header's will be sure to seem incredible to some landsmen,\n"
 "though they themselves may have either seen or heard of some one's\n"
 "falling into a cistern ashore; an accident which not seldom happens,\n"
 "and with much less reason too than the Indian's, considering the\n"
 "exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the Sperm Whale's well.  But,\n"
 "peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We thought the\n"
 "tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and\n"
 "most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element\n"
 "of a far greater specific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not\n"
 "at all, but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had\n"
 "been nearly emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the\n"
 "dense tendinous wall of the well - a double welded, hammered\n"
 "substance, as I have before said, much heavier than the sea water, and\n"
 "a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost. But the tendency to\n"
 "rapid sinking in this substance was in the present instance materially\n"
 "counteracted by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from\n"
 "it, so that it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed, affording\n"
 "Queequeg a fair chance for performing his agile\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " obstetrics on the run, as you may say. Yes, it was a running\n"
 "delivery, so it was.  Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had\n"
 "been a very precious perishing; smothered in the very whitest and\n"
 "daintiest of fragrant spermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the\n"
 "secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the whale. Only one\n"
 "sweeter end can readily be recalled - the delicious death of an Ohio\n"
 "honey-hunter, who seeking honey in the crotch of a hollow tree, found\n"
 "such exceeding store of it, that leaning too far over, it sucked him\n"
 "in, so that he died embalmed. How many, think ye, have likewise fallen\n"
 "into Plato's honey head, and sweetly perished there?\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " To scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head\n"
 "of this Leviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or\n"
 "Phrenologist has as yet undertaken.  Such an enterprise would seem\n"
 "almost as hopeful as for Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on\n"
 "the Rock of Gibraltar, or for Gall to have mounted a ladder and\n"
 "manipulated the Dome of the Pantheon. Still, in that famous work of\n"
 "his, Lavater not only treats of the various faces of men, but also\n"
 "attentively studies the faces of horses, birds, serpents, and fish;\n"
 "and dwells in detail upon the modifications of expression discernible\n"
 "therein. Nor have Gall and his disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out\n"
 "some hints touching the phrenological characteristics of other beings\n"
 "than man. Therefore, though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer, in\n"
 "the application of these two semi-sciences to the whale, I will do my\n"
 "endeavor. I try all things; I achieve what I can.  Physiognomically\n"
 "regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature. He has no proper\n"
 "nose. And since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the\n"
 "features; and since it perhaps\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " most modifies and finally controls their combined expression;\n"
 "hence it would seem that its entire absence, as an external appendage,\n"
 "must very largely affect the countenance of the whale. For as in\n"
 "landscape gardening, a spire, cupola, monument, or tower of some sort,\n"
 "is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene; so no\n"
 "face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open-work\n"
 "belfry of the nose. Dash the nose from Phidias's marble Jove, and what\n"
 "a sorry remainder! Nevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a\n"
 "magnitude, all his proportions are so stately, that the same\n"
 "deficiency which in the sculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no\n"
 "blemish at all. Nay, it is an added grandeur. A nose to the whale\n"
 "would have been impertinent. As on your physiognomical voyage you sail\n"
 "round his vast head in your jolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him\n"
 "are never insulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be\n"
 "pulled. A pestilent conceit, which so often will insist upon obtruding\n"
 "even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne.  In some\n"
 "particulars, perhaps, the most imposing physiognomical view to be had\n"
 "of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head. This aspect\n"
 "is sublime.  In thought a fine human brow is like the east when\n"
 "troubled with the morning. in the repose of the pasture, the curled\n"
 "brow of the bull has a touch of the grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon\n"
 "up mountain defiles, the elephant's brow is majestic. Human or animal,\n"
 "the mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the German\n"
 "emperors to their decrees. It signifies \"God: done this day by my\n"
 "hand\". But in most creatures, nay in man himself, very often the brow\n"
 "is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line. Few are\n"
 "the foreheads which like Shakespeare's or Melancthon's rise so high,\n"
 "and descend so low, that the eyes themselves seem clear, eternal,\n"
 "tideless mountain lakes; and all above them in the forehead's\n"
 "wrinkles, you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to\n"
 "drink, as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer. But\n"
 "in the great Sperm Whale, this high and mighty god-like dignity\n"
 "inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified, that gazing on it, in\n"
 "that full front view, you feel the Deity and the dread powers\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living\n"
 "nature. For you see no one point precisely; not one distinct feature\n"
 "is revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face; he has none,\n"
 "proper; nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead, pleated\n"
 "with riddles; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats, and ships, and\n"
 "men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish; though that\n"
 "way viewed, its grandeur does not domineer upon you so. In profile,\n"
 "you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic depression in\n"
 "the forehead's middle, which, in man, is Lavater's mark of genius.\n"
 "But how? Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written a\n"
 "book, spoken a speech? No, his great genius is declared in his doing\n"
 "nothing particular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his\n"
 "pyramidical silence. And this reminds me that had the great Sperm\n"
 "Whale been known to the young Orient World, he would have been deified\n"
 "by their child-magian thoughts. they deified the crocodile of the\n"
 "nile, because the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm Whale has no\n"
 "tongue, or as least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of\n"
 "protrusion. If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall\n"
 "lure back to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods of old; and\n"
 "livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky; in the now\n"
 "unhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to Jove's high seat, the great\n"
 "Sperm Whale shall lord it.  Champollion deciphered the wrinkled\n"
 "granite hieroglyphics. But there is no Champollion to decipher the\n"
 "Egypt of every man's and every being's face.  Physiognomy, like every\n"
 "other human science, is but a passing fable. If then, Sir William\n"
 "Jones, who read in thirty languages, could not read the simplest\n"
 "peasant's face, in its profounder and more subtle meanings, how may\n"
 "unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale's\n"
 "brow? I but put that brow before you. Read if it you can.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the\n"
 "phrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is\n"
 "impossible to square.  In the full-grown creature the skull will\n"
 "measure at least twenty feet in length. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the\n"
 "side view of this skull is as the side view of a moderately inclined\n"
 "plane resting throughout on a level base. But in life - as we have\n"
 "elsewhere seen - this inclined plane is angularly filled up, and\n"
 "almost squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and\n"
 "sperm. At the high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of\n"
 "the mass; while under the long floor of this crater - in another\n"
 "cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth -\n"
 "reposes the mere handful of this monster's brain.  The brain is at\n"
 "least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden\n"
 "away behind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the\n"
 "amplified fortifications of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it\n"
 "secreted in him, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny\n"
 "that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance\n"
 "of one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine. Lying in\n"
 "strange folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it\n"
 "seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard\n"
 "that mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence.  It is plain,\n"
 "then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in the\n"
 "creature's living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his true\n"
 "brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. The whale,\n"
 "like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the common\n"
 "world.  If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a\n"
 "rear view of its rear end, which is the high end, you will be\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " struck by its resemblance to the human skull, beheld in the\n"
 "same situation, and from the same point of view. Indeed, place this\n"
 "reversed skull (scaled down to the human magnitude) among a plate of\n"
 "men's skulls, and you would involuntarily confound it with them; and\n"
 "remarking the depressions on one part of its summit, in phrenological\n"
 "phrase you would say - This man had no self- esteem, and no\n"
 "veneration. And by those negations, considered along with the\n"
 "affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power, you can best form\n"
 "to yourself the truest, though not the most exhilarating conception of\n"
 "what the most exalted potency is.\n"
 "\n"
 "But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale's proper brain,\n"
 "you deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another\n"
 "idea for you. If you attentively regard almost any quadruped's spine,\n"
 "you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung\n"
 "necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the\n"
 "skull proper. It is a German conceit, that the vertebrae are\n"
 "absolutely undeveloped skulls. But the curious external resemblance, I\n"
 "take it the Germans were not the first men to perceive. A foreign\n"
 "friend once pointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had\n"
 "slain, and with the vertebrae of which he was inlaying, in a sort of\n"
 "basso-relievo, the beaked prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the\n"
 "phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their\n"
 "investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal. For I\n"
 "believe that much of a man's character will be found betokened in his\n"
 "backbone. I would rather feel your spine than your skull, whoever you\n"
 "are. A thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul.\n"
 "I rejoice in my spine, as in the firm audacious staff of that flag\n"
 "which I fling half out to the world.  Apply this spinal branch of\n"
 "phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial cavity is continuous with\n"
 "the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra the bottom of the spinal\n"
 "canal will measure ten inches across, being eight in height, and of a\n"
 "triangular figure with the base downwards. As it passes through the\n"
 "remaining vertebrae the canal tapers in size, but for a considerable\n"
 "distance remains of large capacity. Now, of course, this\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous\n"
 "substance - the spinal cord - as the brain; and directly communicates\n"
 "with the brain. And what is still more, for many feet after emerging\n"
 "from the brain's cavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing\n"
 "girth, almost equal to that of the brain. Under all these\n"
 "circumstances, would it be unreasonable to survey and map out the\n"
 "whale's spine phrenologically? For, viewed in this light, the\n"
 "wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is more than\n"
 "compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord.\n"
 "But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I\n"
 "would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to\n"
 "the Sperm Whale's hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over\n"
 "one of the larger vertebrae, and is, therefore, in some sort, the\n"
 "outer convex mould of it. From its relative situation then, I should\n"
 "call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the\n"
 "Sperm Whale. And that the great monster is indomitable, you will yet\n"
 "have reason to know.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship\n"
 "Jungfrau, Derick De Deer, master, of Bremen.  At one time the greatest\n"
 "whaling people in the world, the Dutch and Germans are now among the\n"
 "least; but here and there at very wide intervals of latitude and\n"
 "longitude, you still occasionally meet with their flag in the Pacific.\n"
 "For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her\n"
 "respects. While yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and\n"
 "dropping a boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently\n"
 "standing in the bows instead of the stern.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"What has he in his hand there?\" cried Starbuck, pointing to\n"
 "something wavingly held by the German. \"Impossible! - a lamp-feeder!\"\n"
 "\"Not that,\" said Stubb, \"no, no, it's a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck; he's\n"
 "coming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don't you see that\n"
 "big tin can there alongside of him? - that's his boiling water. Oh!\n"
 "he's all right, is the Yarman.\"  \"Go along with you,\" cried Flask,\n"
 "\"it's a lamp- feeder and an oil-can. He's out of oil, and has come a-\n"
 "begging.\"  However curious it may seem for an oil- ship to be\n"
 "borrowing oil on the whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly\n"
 "contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet\n"
 "sometimes such a thing really happens; and in the present case Captain\n"
 "Derick De Deer did indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did\n"
 "declare.  As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without\n"
 "at all heeding what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the\n"
 "German soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale;\n"
 "immediately turning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can,\n"
 "with some remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at\n"
 "night in profound darkness - his last drop of Bremen oil being gone,\n"
 "and not a single flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency;\n"
 "concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is\n"
 "technically called a clean one (that is, an empty one), well deserving\n"
 "the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin.  His necessities supplied, Derick\n"
 "departed; but he had not gained his ship's side, when whales were\n"
 "almost simultaneously raised from the mast-heads of both vessels; and\n"
 "so eager for the chase was Derick, that without pausing to put his\n"
 "oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed round his boat and made\n"
 "after the Leviathan lamp-feeders.  Now, the game having risen to\n"
 "leeward, he and the other three German boats that soon followed him,\n"
 "had considerably the start of the Pequod's keels. There were eight\n"
 "whales, an average pod. Aware of their danger, they were going all\n"
 "abreast with great speed straight before the wind, rubbing their\n"
 "flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness. They left a\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling a great\n"
 "wide parchment upon the sea.  Full in this rapid wake, and many\n"
 "fathoms in the rear, swam a huge, humped old bull, which by his\n"
 "comparatively slow progress, as well as by the unusual yellowish\n"
 "incrustations overgrowing him, seemed afflicted with the jaundice, or\n"
 "some other infirmity. Whether this whale belonged to the pod in\n"
 "advance, seemed questionable; for it is not customary for such\n"
 "venerable Leviathans to be at all social. Nevertheless, he stuck to\n"
 "their wake, though indeed their back water must have retarded him,\n"
 "because the white-bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one,\n"
 "like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet. His spout was\n"
 "short, slow, and laborious; coming forth with a choking sort of gush,\n"
 "and spending itself in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean\n"
 "commotions in him, which seemed to have egress at his other buried\n"
 "extremity, causing the waters behind him to upbubble.  \"Who's got some\n"
 "paregoric?\" said Stubb, \"he has the stomach-ache, I'm afraid.  Lord,\n"
 "think of having half an acre of stomach-ache! Adverse winds are\n"
 "holding mad Christmas in him, boys. It's the first foul wind I ever\n"
 "knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so before? it\n"
 "must be, he's lost his tiller.\"  As an overladen Indiaman bearing down\n"
 "the Hindostan coast with a deck load of frightened horses, careens,\n"
 "buries, rolls, and wallows on her way; so did this old whale heave his\n"
 "aged bulk, and now and then partly turning over on his cumbrous\n"
 "rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump\n"
 "of his starboard fin. Whether he had lost that fin in battle, or had\n"
 "been born without it, it were hard to say.  \"Only wait a bit, old\n"
 "chap, and I'll give ye a sling for that wounded arm,\" cried cruel\n"
 "Flask, pointing to the whale- line near him.  \"Mind he don't sling\n"
 "thee with it,\" cried Starbuck. \"Give way, or the German will have\n"
 "him.\"  With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for\n"
 "this one fish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the\n"
 "most valuable whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales\n"
 "were going with such great velocity, moreover,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " as almost to defy pursuit for the time. At this juncture, the\n"
 "Pequod's keel had shot by the three German boats last lowered; but\n"
 "from the great start he had had, Derick's boat still led the chase,\n"
 "though every moment neared by his foreign rivals. The only thing they\n"
 "feared, was, that from being already so nigh to his mark, he would be\n"
 "enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and\n"
 "pass him. as for derick, he seemed quite confident that this would be\n"
 "the case, and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his\n"
 "lamp-feeder at the other boats.  \"The ungracious and ungrateful dog!\"\n"
 "cried Starbuck; \"he mocks and dares me with the very poor-box I filled\n"
 "for him not five minutes ago!\" - then in his old intense whisper -\n"
 "\"give way, greyhounds! Dog to it!\"  \"I tell ye what it is, men\" -\n"
 "cried Stubb to his crew - \"It's against my religion to get mad; but\n"
 "I'd like to eat that villanous Yarman - Pull - won't ye? Are ye going\n"
 "to let that rascal beat ye? Do ye love brandy? A hogshead of brandy,\n"
 "then, to the best man. Come, why don't some of ye burst a\n"
 "blood-vessel?  Who's that been dropping an anchor overboard - we don't\n"
 "budge an inch - we're becalmed. Halloo, here's grass growing in the\n"
 "boat's bottom - and by the Lord, the mast there's budding. This won't\n"
 "do, boys. Look at that Yarman! The short and long of it is, men, will\n"
 "ye spit fire or not?\"  \"Oh! see the suds he makes!\" cried Flask,\n"
 "dancing up and down - \"What a hump - Oh,do pile on the beef - lays\n"
 "like a log! Oh! my lads, do spring - slap-jacks and quohogs for\n"
 "supper, you know, my lads - baked clams and muffins - oh, do, do\n"
 "spring - he's a hundred barreler - don't lose him now - don't oh,\n"
 "don't! - see that Yarman - Oh! won't ye pull for your duff, my lads -\n"
 "such a sog! such a sogger! Don't ye love sperm? There goes three\n"
 "thousand dollars, men! - a bank! - a whole bank! The bank of England!\n"
 "- Oh, do, do, do! - What's that Yarman about now?\"  At this moment\n"
 "Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the advancing\n"
 "boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double view of retarding\n"
 "his rivals' way, and at the same time economically accelerating his\n"
 "own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.  \"The unmannerly\n"
 "Dutch dogger!\" cried Stubb. \"Pull now,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " men, like fifty thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of\n"
 "red-haired devils. What d'ye say, Tashtego; are you the man to snap\n"
 "your spine in two-and-twenty pieces for the honor of old Gay-head?\n"
 "What d'ye say?\"  \"I say, pull like god-dam,\" - cried the Indian.\n"
 "Fiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the Pequod's\n"
 "three boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed,\n"
 "momentarily neared him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of\n"
 "the headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up\n"
 "proudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating\n"
 "cry of, \"There she slides, now! Hurrah for the white-ash breeze! Down\n"
 "with the Yarman! Sail over him!\"  But so decided an original start had\n"
 "Derick had, that spite of all their gallantry, he would have proved\n"
 "the victor in this race, had not a righteous judgment descended upon\n"
 "him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship oarsman. While\n"
 "this clumsy lubber was striving to free his white-ash, and while, in\n"
 "consequence, Derick's boat was nigh to capsizing, and he thundering\n"
 "away at his men in a mighty rage; - that was a good time for Starbuck,\n"
 "Stubb, and Flask.  With a shout, they took a mortal start forwards,\n"
 "and slantingly ranged up on the German's quarter. An instant more, and\n"
 "all four boats were diagonically in the whale's immediate wake, while\n"
 "stretching from them, on both sides, was the foaming swell that he\n"
 "made.  It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The\n"
 "whale was now going head out, and sending his spout before him in a\n"
 "continual tormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an\n"
 "agony of fright. Now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his\n"
 "faltering flight, and still at every billow that he broke, he\n"
 "spasmodically sank in the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his\n"
 "one beating fin. So have I seen a bird with clipped wing, making\n"
 "affrighted broken circles in the air, vainly striving to escape the\n"
 "piratical hawks. But the bird has a voice, and with plaintive cries\n"
 "will make known her fear; but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the\n"
 "sea, was chained up and enchanted in him; he had no voice, save that\n"
 "choking respiration through his spiracle, and this made the sight of\n"
 "him unspeakably\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " pitiable; while still, in his amazing bulk, portcullis jaw,\n"
 "and omnipotent tail, there was enough to appal the stoutest man who so\n"
 "pitied.  Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the\n"
 "Pequod's boats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his\n"
 "game, Derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most\n"
 "unusually long dart, ere the last chance would for ever escape.  But\n"
 "no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all three\n"
 "tigers - Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo - instinctively sprang to their\n"
 "feet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their\n"
 "barbs; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their three\n"
 "Nantucket irons entered the whale.  Blinding vapors of foam and\n"
 "white-fire! The three boats, in the first fury of the whale's headlong\n"
 "rush, bumped the German's aside with such force, that both Derick and\n"
 "his baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three\n"
 "flying keels.  \"Don't be afraid, my butter-boxes,\" cried Stubb,\n"
 "casting a passing glance upon them as he shot by; \"ye'll be picked up\n"
 "presently - all right - I saw some sharks astern - St. Bernard's dogs,\n"
 "you know - relieve distressed travellers.  Hurrah! this is the way to\n"
 "sail now. Every keel a sun-beam! Hurrah! - Here we go like three tin\n"
 "kettles at the tail of a mad cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening\n"
 "to an elephant in a tilbury on a plain - makes the wheel-spokes fly,\n"
 "boys, when you fasten to him that way; and there's danger of being\n"
 "pitched out too, when you strike a hill. Hurrah! this is the way a\n"
 "fellow feels when he's going to Davy Jones - all a rush down an\n"
 "endless inclined plane! Hurrah! this whale carries the everlasting\n"
 "mail!  But the monster's run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he\n"
 "tumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round\n"
 "the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them;\n"
 "while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would\n"
 "soon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they\n"
 "caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at last -\n"
 "owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of the\n"
 "boats, whence the three\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " ropes went straight down into the blue - the gunwales of the\n"
 "bows were almost even with the water, while the three sterns tilted\n"
 "high in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound, for some time\n"
 "they remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more line, though\n"
 "the position was a little ticklish. But though boats have been taken\n"
 "down and lost in this way, yet it is this \"holding on,\" as it is\n"
 "called; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the\n"
 "back; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising\n"
 "again to meet the sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the\n"
 "peril of the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is always\n"
 "the best; for it is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the\n"
 "stricken whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted. Because,\n"
 "owing to the enormous surface of him - in a full grown Sperm Whale\n"
 "something less than 2000 square feet - the pressure of the water is\n"
 "immense. We all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we\n"
 "ourselves stand up under; even here, above-ground, in the air; how\n"
 "vast, then, the burden of a whale, bearing on his back a column of two\n"
 "hundred fathoms of ocean! It must at least equal the weight of fifty\n"
 "atmospheres. One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty\n"
 "line-of-battle ships, with all their guns, and stores, and men on\n"
 "board.  As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea,\n"
 "gazing down into its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or\n"
 "cry of any sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from\n"
 "its depths; what landsman would have thought, that beneath all that\n"
 "silence and placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and\n"
 "wrenching in agony! Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were\n"
 "visible at the bows. Seems it credible that by three such thin threads\n"
 "the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day\n"
 "clock.  Suspended? and to what? To three bits of board. Is this the\n"
 "creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said - \"Canst thou fill\n"
 "his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish- spears? The sword\n"
 "of him that layeth at him cannot hold, the spear, the dart, nor the\n"
 "habergeon: he esteemeth iron as straw; the arrow cannot make him flee;\n"
 "darts are counted as stubble; he laugheth at the shaking of a spear!\"\n"
 "This the creature? this he? Oh! that unfulfilments\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " should follow the prophets. For with the strength of a\n"
 "thousand thighs in his tail, Leviathan had run his head under the\n"
 "mountains of the sea, to hide him from the Pequod's fish-spears!  In\n"
 "that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats sent\n"
 "down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad enough\n"
 "to shade half Xerxes' army. Who can tell how appalling to the wounded\n"
 "whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head!\n"
 "\"Stand by, men; he stirs,\" cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly\n"
 "vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by\n"
 "magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so that every\n"
 "oarsman felt them in his seat.  The next moment, relieved in a great\n"
 "part from the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden\n"
 "bounce upwards, as a small ice-field will, when a dense herd of white\n"
 "bears are scared from it into the sea.  \"Haul in! Haul in!\" cried\n"
 "Starbuck again; \"he's rising.\"  The lines, of which, hardly an instant\n"
 "before, not one hand's breadth could have been gained, were now in\n"
 "long quick coils flung back all dripping into the boats, and soon the\n"
 "whale broke water within two ship's lengths of the hunters.  His\n"
 "motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land animals\n"
 "there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins,\n"
 "whereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly\n"
 "shut off in certain directions.  Not so with the whale; one of whose\n"
 "peculiarities it is, to have an entire nonvalvular structure of the\n"
 "blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point as a\n"
 "harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial\n"
 "system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of\n"
 "water at a great distance below the surface, his life may be said to\n"
 "pour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of\n"
 "blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior fountains, that\n"
 "he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period;\n"
 "even as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the\n"
 "well-springs of far-off and undiscernible hills. Even now, when the\n"
 "boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " flukes, and the lances were darted into him, they were\n"
 "followed by steady jets from the new made wound, which kept\n"
 "continually playing, while the natural spout-hole in his head was only\n"
 "at intervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture into the\n"
 "air. From this last vent no blood yet came, because no vital part of\n"
 "him had thus far been struck. His life, as they significantly call it,\n"
 "was untouched.  As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the\n"
 "whole upper part of his form, with much of it that is ordinarily\n"
 "submerged, was plainly revealed. His eyes, or rather the places where\n"
 "his eyes had been, were beheld. As strange misgrown masses gather in\n"
 "the knot-holes of the noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points\n"
 "which the whale's eyes had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs,\n"
 "horribly pitiable to see. but pity there was none. For all his old\n"
 "age, and his one arm, and his blind eyes, he must die the death and be\n"
 "murdered, in order to light the gay bridals and other merry-makings of\n"
 "men, and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach\n"
 "unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all. Still rolling in his\n"
 "blood, at last he partially disclosed a strangely discolored bunch or\n"
 "protuberance, the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.  \"A nice\n"
 "spot,\" cried Flask; \"just let me prick him there once.\"  \"Avast!\"\n"
 "cried Starbuck, \"there's no need of that!\"  But humane Starbuck was\n"
 "too late. At the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet shot from this\n"
 "cruel wound, and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish, the\n"
 "whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury blindly darted at the\n"
 "craft, bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with\n"
 "showers of gore, capsizing Flask's boat and marring the bows. It was\n"
 "his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he by loss of blood,\n"
 "that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made; lay panting\n"
 "on his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin, then over and\n"
 "over slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up the white secrets\n"
 "of his belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most piteous, that last\n"
 "expiring spout. As when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn\n"
 "off from some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled melancholy\n"
 "gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the ground - so the\n"
 "last long dying spout of the whale.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship,\n"
 "the body showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures\n"
 "unrifled. Immediately, by Starbuck's orders, lines were secured to it\n"
 "at different points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the\n"
 "sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the\n"
 "cords. By very heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale\n"
 "was transferred to her side, and was strongly secured there by the\n"
 "stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially\n"
 "upheld, the body would at once sink to the bottom.  It so chanced that\n"
 "almost upon first cutting into him with the spade, the entire length\n"
 "of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh, on the lower\n"
 "part of the bunch before described. But as the stumps of harpoons are\n"
 "frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales, with the flesh\n"
 "perfectly healed around them, and no prominence of any kind to denote\n"
 "their place; therefore, there must needs have been some other unknown\n"
 "reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded\n"
 "to. But still more curious was the fact of a lance-head of stone being\n"
 "found in him, not far from the buried iron, the flesh perfectly firm\n"
 "about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And when? It might have\n"
 "been darted by some Nor' West Indian long before America was\n"
 "discovered.  What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this\n"
 "monstrous cabinet there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to\n"
 "further discoveries, by the ship's being unprecedentedly dragged over\n"
 "sideways to the sea, owing to the body's immensely increasing tendency\n"
 "to sink. However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of affairs, hung on\n"
 "to it to the last; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that when at\n"
 "length the ship would have been capsized, if still persisting in\n"
 "locking arms with the body; then, when the command was given to break\n"
 "clear from it, such was the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to\n"
 "which the fluke-chains and cables were fastened, that it was\n"
 "impossible to cast them off. Meantime everything in the Pequod was\n"
 "aslant. To cross to the other side of the deck was like walking up the\n"
 "steep gabled roof of a house. The ship groaned and gasped.  Many of\n"
 "the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their\n"
 "places, by the unnatural dislocation. In\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the\n"
 "immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timber-heads; and\n"
 "so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be\n"
 "at all approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed\n"
 "added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going\n"
 "over.  \"Hold on, hold on, won't ye?\" cried Stubb to the body, \"don't\n"
 "be in such a devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do\n"
 "something or go for it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your\n"
 "handspikes, and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and\n"
 "cut the big chains.\"  \"Knife? Aye, aye,\" cried Queequeg, and seizing\n"
 "the carpenter's heavy hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel\n"
 "to iron, began slashing at the largest fluke- chains. But a few\n"
 "strokes, full of sparks, were given, when the exceeding strain\n"
 "effected the rest. With a terrific snap, every fastening went adrift;\n"
 "the ship righted, the carcase sank.  Now, this occasional inevitable\n"
 "sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale is a very curious thing;\n"
 "nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it.  Usually the\n"
 "dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy, with its side or belly\n"
 "considerably elevated above the surface. If the only whales that thus\n"
 "sank were old, meagre, and broken-hearted creatures, their pads of\n"
 "lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic; then you\n"
 "might with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an\n"
 "uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking, consequent upon this\n"
 "absence of buoyant matter in him. But it is not so. For young whales,\n"
 "in the highest health, and swelling with noble aspirations,\n"
 "prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of life, with all their\n"
 "panting lard about them; even these brawny, buoyant heroes do\n"
 "sometimes sink.  Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less\n"
 "liable to this accident than any other species. Where one of that sort\n"
 "go down, twenty Right Whales do.  This difference in the species is no\n"
 "doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in\n"
 "the Right Whale; his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more\n"
 "than a ton; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free.  But\n"
 "there are instances where,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken\n"
 "whale again rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this\n"
 "is obvious. Gases are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious\n"
 "magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship\n"
 "could hardly keep him under then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings,\n"
 "among the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right Whale gives token of\n"
 "sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty of rope; so that when\n"
 "the body has gone down, they know where to look for it when it shall\n"
 "have ascended again.  It was not long after the sinking of the body\n"
 "that a cry was heard from the Pequod's mast-heads, announcing that the\n"
 "Jungfrau was again lowering her boats; though the only spout in sight\n"
 "was that of a Fin-Back, belonging to the species of uncapturable\n"
 "whales, because of its incredible power of swimming.  Nevertheless,\n"
 "the Fin-Back's spout is so similar to the Sperm Whale's, that by\n"
 "unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it. And consequently\n"
 "Derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable\n"
 "brute. The Virgin crowding all sail, made after her four young keels,\n"
 "and thus they all disappeared far to leeward, still in bold, hopeful\n"
 "chase.  Oh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my\n"
 "friend.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness\n"
 "is the true method.\n"
 "\n"
 "The more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches up\n"
 "to the very spring-head of it, so much the more am I impressed with\n"
 "its great honorableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so\n"
 "many great demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or\n"
 "other have shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the\n"
 "reflection that I myself\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " belong, though but subordinately, to so emblazoned a\n"
 "fraternity.  The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first\n"
 "whaleman; and to the eternal honor of our calling be it said, that the\n"
 "first whale attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid\n"
 "intent. Those were the knightly days of our profession, when we only\n"
 "bore arms to succor the distressed, and not to fill men's\n"
 "lamp-feeders. Every one knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda;\n"
 "how the lovely Andromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock\n"
 "on the sea-coast, and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her\n"
 "off, Perseus, the prince of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned\n"
 "the monster, and delivered and married the maid. It was an admirable\n"
 "artistic exploit, rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the\n"
 "present day; inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first\n"
 "dart. And let no man doubt this Arkite story; for in the ancient\n"
 "Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast, in one of the Pagan temples,\n"
 "there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale, which the\n"
 "city's legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical\n"
 "bones of the monster that Perseus slew. When the Romans took Joppa,\n"
 "the same skeleton was carried to Italy in triumph. What seems most\n"
 "singular and suggestively important in this story, is this: it was\n"
 "from Joppa that Jonah set sail.  Akin to the adventure of Perseus and\n"
 "Andromeda - indeed, by some supposed to be indirectly derived from it\n"
 "- is that famous story of St. George and the Dragon; which dragon I\n"
 "maintain to have been a whale; for in many old chronicles whales and\n"
 "dragons are strangely jumbled together, and often stand for each\n"
 "other.  \"Thou art as a lion of the waters, and as a dragon of the\n"
 "sea,\" saith Ezekiel; hereby, plainly meaning a whale; in truth, some\n"
 "versions of the Bible use that word itself. Besides, it would much\n"
 "subtract from the glory of the exploit had St. George but encountered\n"
 "a crawling reptile of the land, instead of doing battle with the great\n"
 "monster of the deep. Any man may kill a snake, but only a Perseus, a\n"
 "St. George, a Coffin, have the heart in them to march boldly up to a\n"
 "whale.  Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for\n"
 "though the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is\n"
 "vaguely represented of a griffin- like shape, and though\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the battle is depicted on land and the saint on horseback,\n"
 "yet considering the great ignorance of those times, when the true form\n"
 "of the whale was unknown to artists; and considering that as in\n"
 "Perseus' case, St. George's whale might have crawled up out of the sea\n"
 "on the beach; and considering that the animal ridden by St. George\n"
 "might have been only a large seal, or sea-horse; bearing all this in\n"
 "mind, it will not appear altogether incompatible with the sacred\n"
 "legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene, to hold this\n"
 "so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself. In fact,\n"
 "placed before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story will\n"
 "fare like that fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines, Dagon by\n"
 "name; who being planted before the ark of Israel, his horse's head and\n"
 "both the palms of his hands fell off from him, and only the stump or\n"
 "fishy part of him remained. Thus, then, one of our own noble stamp,\n"
 "even a whaleman, is the tutelary guardian of England; and by good\n"
 "rights, we harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most\n"
 "noble order of St.  George. And therefore, let not the knights of that\n"
 "honorable company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever had to do\n"
 "with a whale like their great patron), let them never eye a\n"
 "Nantucketer with disdain, since even in our woollen frocks and tarred\n"
 "trowsers we are much better entitled to st. george's decoration than\n"
 "they.  Whether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I\n"
 "long remained dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies,\n"
 "that antique Crockett and Kit Carson - that brawny doer of rejoicing\n"
 "good deeds, was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still,\n"
 "whether that strictly makes a whaleman of him, that might be\n"
 "mooted. It nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish,\n"
 "unless, indeed, from the inside. Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort\n"
 "of involuntary whaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did\n"
 "not the whale.  I claim him for one of our clan.  But, by the best\n"
 "contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of Hercules and the\n"
 "whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient Hebrew\n"
 "story of Jonah and the whale; and vice versa; certainly they are very\n"
 "similar. If I claim the demigod then, why not the prophet?\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise\n"
 "the whole roll of our order. Our grand master is still to be named;\n"
 "for like royal kings of old times, we find the headwaters of our\n"
 "fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves. That\n"
 "wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster, which\n"
 "gives us the dread Vishnoo, one of the three persons in the godhead of\n"
 "the Hindoos; gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for our Lord; -\n"
 "Vishnoo, who, by the first of his ten earthly incarnations, has for\n"
 "ever set apart and sanctified the whale. When Brahma, or the God of\n"
 "Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved to recreate the world after one of\n"
 "its periodical dissolutions, he gave birth to Vishnoo, to preside over\n"
 "the work; but the Vedas, or mystical books, whose perusal would seem\n"
 "to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before beginning the creation,\n"
 "and which therefore must have contained something in the shape of\n"
 "practical hints to young architects, these Vedas were lying at the\n"
 "bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became incarnate in a whale, and\n"
 "sounding down in him to the uttermost depths, rescued the sacred\n"
 "volumes. Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman, then? even as a man who\n"
 "rides a horse is called a horseman?  Perseus, St. George, Hercules,\n"
 "Jonah, and Vishnoo! there's a member-roll for you! What club but the\n"
 "whaleman's can head off like that?\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the\n"
 "whale in the preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust\n"
 "this historical story of Jonah and the whale. But then there were some\n"
 "sceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox\n"
 "pagans of their times, equally doubted the story of Hercules and the\n"
 "whale, and Arion and the dolphin;\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those\n"
 "traditions one whit the less facts, for all that.  One old Sag-Harbor\n"
 "whaleman's chief reason for questioning the Hebrew story was this: -\n"
 "He had one of those quaint old- fashioned Bibles, embellished with\n"
 "curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented Jonah's whale\n"
 "with two spouts in his head - a peculiarity only true with respect to\n"
 "a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the varieties of that\n"
 "order), concerning which the fishermen have this saying, \"A penny roll\n"
 "would choke him;\" his swallow is so very small. But, to this, Bishop\n"
 "Jebb's anticipative answer is ready. It is not necessary, hints the\n"
 "Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the whale's belly, but as\n"
 "temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And this seems\n"
 "reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the Right Whale's\n"
 "mouth would accommodate a couple of whist tables, and comfortably seat\n"
 "all the players.  Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in\n"
 "a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right Whale is toothless.\n"
 "Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his\n"
 "want of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely\n"
 "in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale's gastric\n"
 "juices. But this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a\n"
 "German exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the\n"
 "floating body of a dead whale - even as the French soldiers in the\n"
 "Russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents, and crawled into\n"
 "them. Besides, it has been divined by other continental commentators,\n"
 "that when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he\n"
 "straightway effected his escape to another vessel near by, some vessel\n"
 "with a whale for a figure-head; and, I would add, possibly called \"The\n"
 "Whale\", as some craft are nowadays christened the \"Shark,\" the \"Gull,\"\n"
 "the \"Eagle\". Nor have there been wanting learned exegetists who have\n"
 "opined that the whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant a\n"
 "life- preserver - an inflated bag of wind - which the endangered\n"
 "prophet swam to, and so was saved from a watery doom. Poor Sag-\n"
 "Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round. But he had still another\n"
 "reason for his want of faith. It was this, if I remember right: Jonah\n"
 "was\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea, and after\n"
 "three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days' journey of\n"
 "Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much more than three days' journey\n"
 "across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean coast. How is that?\n"
 "But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within\n"
 "that short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round\n"
 "by the way of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage\n"
 "through the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another passage up\n"
 "the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the\n"
 "complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of\n"
 "the Tigris waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any\n"
 "whale to swim in. Besides, this idea of Jonah's weathering the Cape of\n"
 "Good Hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of\n"
 "that great headland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and\n"
 "so make modern history a liar.  But all these foolish arguments of old\n"
 "Sag-Harbor only evinced his foolish pride of reason - a thing still\n"
 "more reprehensible in him, seeing that he had but little learning\n"
 "except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea. I say it only\n"
 "shows his foolish, impious pride, and abominable, devilish rebellion\n"
 "against the reverend clergy. For by a Portuguese Catholic priest, this\n"
 "very idea of Jonah's going to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was\n"
 "advanced as a signal magnification of the general miracle. And so it\n"
 "was. Besides, to this day, the highly enlightened Turks devoutly\n"
 "believe in the historical story of Jonah. And some three centuries\n"
 "ago, an English traveller in old Harris's Voyages, speaks of a Turkish\n"
 "Mosque built in honor of Jonah, in which mosque was a miraculous lamp\n"
 "that burnt without any oil.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages\n"
 "are anointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an\n"
 "analogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it\n"
 "to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly\n"
 "be of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil and water are\n"
 "hostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object in view is\n"
 "to make the boat slide bravely. Queequeg believed strongly in\n"
 "anointing his boat, and one morning not long after the German ship\n"
 "Jungfrau disappeared, took more than customary pains in that\n"
 "occupation; crawling under its bottom, where it hung over the side,\n"
 "and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure\n"
 "a crop of hair from the craft's bald keel. He seemed to be working in\n"
 "obedience to some particular presentiment. Nor did it remain\n"
 "unwarranted by the event.  Towards noon whales were raised; but so\n"
 "soon as the ship sailed down to them, they turned and fled with swift\n"
 "precipitancy; a disordered flight, as of Cleopatra's barges from\n"
 "Actium.  Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb's was foremost. By\n"
 "great exertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but\n"
 "the stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his\n"
 "horizontal flight, with added fleetness.  Such unintermitted\n"
 "strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably\n"
 "extract it. It became imperative to lance the flying whale, or be\n"
 "content to lose him. But to haul the boat up to his flank was\n"
 "impossible, he swam so fast and furious. What then remained?  Of all\n"
 "the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and\n"
 "countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often\n"
 "forced, none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called\n"
 "pitchpoling. Small sword, or broad sword, in all its\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " exercises boasts nothing like it. It is only indispensable\n"
 "with an inveterate running whale; its grand fact and feature is the\n"
 "wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately darted from a\n"
 "violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme headway. Steel and wood\n"
 "included, the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length; the\n"
 "staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon, and also of a lighter\n"
 "material - pine. It is furnished with a small rope called a warp, of\n"
 "considerable length, by which it can be hauled back to the hand after\n"
 "darting.  But before going further, it is important to mention here,\n"
 "that though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the\n"
 "lance, yet it is seldom done; and when done, is still less frequently\n"
 "successful, on account of the greater weight and inferior length of\n"
 "the harpoon as compared with the lance, which in effect become serious\n"
 "drawbacks. As a general thing, therefore, you must first get fast to a\n"
 "whale, before any pitchpoling comes into play.  Look now at Stubb; a\n"
 "man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and equanimity in the\n"
 "direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel in\n"
 "pitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the\n"
 "flying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet\n"
 "ahead. Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along\n"
 "its length to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers\n"
 "up the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in\n"
 "his grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed. Then holding the lance full\n"
 "before his waistband's middle, he levels it at the whale; when,\n"
 "covering him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand,\n"
 "thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced\n"
 "upon his palm, fifteen feet in the air. He minds you somewhat of a\n"
 "juggler, balancing a long staff on his chin. Next moment with a rapid,\n"
 "nameless impulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the\n"
 "foaming distance, and quivers in the life spot of the whale. Instead\n"
 "of sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.  \"That drove the spigot\n"
 "out of him!\" cries Stubb. \"'Tis July's immortal Fourth; all fountains\n"
 "must run wine to-day! Would now, it were old Orleans whiskey, or old\n"
 "Ohio, or unspeakable\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " old Monongahela! Then, Tashtego, lad, I'd have ye hold a\n"
 "canakin to the jet, and we'd drink round it! Yea, verily, hearts\n"
 "alive, we'd brew choice punch in the spread of his spout-hole there,\n"
 "and from that live punch-bowl quaff the living stuff!\"  Again and\n"
 "again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated, the spear\n"
 "returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash. The\n"
 "agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line is slackened, and\n"
 "the pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands, and mutely watches\n"
 "the monster die.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " That for six thousand years - and no one knows how many\n"
 "millions of ages before - the great whales should have been spouting\n"
 "all over the sea, and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the\n"
 "deep, as with so many sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some\n"
 "centuries back, thousands of hunters should have been close by the\n"
 "fountain of the whale, watching these sprinklings and spoutings - that\n"
 "all this should be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen\n"
 "and a quarter minutes past one o'clock P. M. of this sixteenth day of\n"
 "December, A.  D. 1851), it should still remain a problem, whether\n"
 "these spoutings are, after all, really water, or nothing but vapor -\n"
 "this is surely a noteworthy thing.  Let us, then, look at this matter,\n"
 "along with some interesting items contingent.  Every one knows that by\n"
 "the peculiar cunning of their gills, the finny tribes in general\n"
 "breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in\n"
 "which they swim, hence, a herring or a cod might live a century, and\n"
 "never once raise its head above the surface. But owing to his marked\n"
 "internal structure which gives him regular lungs, like a human\n"
 "being's, the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the\n"
 "open atmosphere. Wherefore the necessity\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " for his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot\n"
 "in any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary\n"
 "attitude, the Sperm Whale's mouth is buried at least eight feet\n"
 "beneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no\n"
 "connexion with his mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone;\n"
 "and this is on the top of his head.  If I say, that in any creature\n"
 "breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it\n"
 "withdraws from the air a certain element, which being subsequently\n"
 "brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying\n"
 "principle, I do not think I shall err; though I may possibly use some\n"
 "superfluous scientific words. Assume it, and it follows that if all\n"
 "the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath, he might then\n"
 "seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable\n"
 "time. That is to say, he would then live without breathing. Anomalous\n"
 "as it may seem, this is precisely the case with the whale, who\n"
 "systematically lives, by intervals, his full hour and more (when at\n"
 "the bottom) without drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way\n"
 "inhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has no gills. How is\n"
 "this? Between his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied\n"
 "with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like\n"
 "vessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are completely\n"
 "distended with oxygenated blood. So that for an hour or more, a\n"
 "thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of vitality in\n"
 "him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus\n"
 "supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs. The\n"
 "anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the\n"
 "supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more\n"
 "cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of\n"
 "that Leviathan in having his spoutings out, as the fishermen phrase\n"
 "it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon rising to the surface,\n"
 "the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time exactly\n"
 "uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven\n"
 "minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths;\n"
 "then whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy\n"
 "breaths over again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " breaths you alarm him, so that he sounds, he will be always\n"
 "dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air. And not\n"
 "till those seventy breaths are told, will he finally go down to stay\n"
 "out his full term below. Remark, however, that in different\n"
 "individuals these rates are different; but in any one they are\n"
 "alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings\n"
 "out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere descending\n"
 "for good? How obvious is it, too, that this necessity for the whale's\n"
 "rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase. For not by\n"
 "hook or by net could this vast Leviathan be caught, when sailing a\n"
 "thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O\n"
 "hunter, as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee!  In\n"
 "man, breathing is incessantly going on - one breath only serving for\n"
 "two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to\n"
 "attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But\n"
 "the Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.\n"
 "It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole;\n"
 "if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water,\n"
 "then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of\n"
 "smell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at\n"
 "all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so\n"
 "clogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power\n"
 "of smelling. But owing to the mystery of the spout - whether it be\n"
 "water or whether it be vapor - no absolute certainty can as yet be\n"
 "arrived at on this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm\n"
 "Whale has no proper olfactories. But what does he want of them? No\n"
 "roses, no violets, no Cologne-water in the sea.  Furthermore, as his\n"
 "windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal, and as that\n"
 "long canal - like the grand Erie Canal - is furnished with a sort of\n"
 "locks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of air or the\n"
 "upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice; unless\n"
 "you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely rumbles, he talks\n"
 "through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to say? Seldom\n"
 "have I known any profound being that had anything to say to this\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of\n"
 "getting a living. Oh!  happy that the world is such an excellent\n"
 "listener!  Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly\n"
 "intended as it is for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid\n"
 "along, horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a\n"
 "little to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe\n"
 "laid down in a city on one side of a street. But the question returns\n"
 "whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether\n"
 "the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath,\n"
 "or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the\n"
 "mouth, and discharged through the spiracle. It is certain that the\n"
 "mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot\n"
 "be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through\n"
 "the spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem\n"
 "to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm\n"
 "Whale's food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout\n"
 "even if he would. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time\n"
 "him with your watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an\n"
 "undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary\n"
 "periods of respiration.  But why pester one with all this reasoning on\n"
 "the subject? Speak out! You have seen him spout; then declare what the\n"
 "spout is; can you not tell water from air?  My dear sir, in this world\n"
 "it is not so easy to settle these plain things. I have ever found your\n"
 "plain things the knottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you\n"
 "might almost stand in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is\n"
 "precisely.  The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling\n"
 "mist enveloping it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water\n"
 "falls from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to\n"
 "get a close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the\n"
 "water cascading all around him. And if at such times you should think\n"
 "that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you\n"
 "know that they are not merely condensed from its vapor; or how do you\n"
 "know that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in\n"
 "the spout-hole fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the\n"
 "whale's head?  For even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " sea in a calm, with his elevated hump sun-dried as a\n"
 "dromedary's in the desert; even then, the whale always carries a small\n"
 "basin of water on his head, as under a blazing sun you will sometimes\n"
 "see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain.  Nor is it at all prudent\n"
 "for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the\n"
 "whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering into it, and putting\n"
 "his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to this fountain and\n"
 "fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into slight contact\n"
 "with the outer, vapory shreds of the jet, which will often happen,\n"
 "your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of the thing so\n"
 "touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer contact with\n"
 "the spout, whether with some scientific object in view, or otherwise,\n"
 "I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm. Wherefore,\n"
 "among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade\n"
 "it. Another thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it,\n"
 "that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you.\n"
 "The wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to\n"
 "let this deadly spout alone.  Still, we can hypothesize, even if we\n"
 "cannot prove and establish. My hypothesis is this: that the spout is\n"
 "nothing but mist. And besides other reasons, to this conclusion I am\n"
 "impelled, by considerations touching the great inherent dignity and\n"
 "sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I account him no common, shallow being,\n"
 "inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on\n"
 "soundings, or near shores; all other whales sometimes are. He is both\n"
 "ponderous and profound.  And I am convinced that from the heads of all\n"
 "ponderous profound beings, such as Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter,\n"
 "Dante, and so on, there always goes up a certain semi-visible steam,\n"
 "while in the act of thinking deep thoughts. While composing a little\n"
 "treatise on Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror before me;\n"
 "and ere long saw reflected there, a curious involved worming and\n"
 "undulation in the atmosphere over my head. The invariable moisture of\n"
 "my hair, while plunged in deep thought, after six cups of hot tea in\n"
 "my thin shingled attic, of an August noon; this seems an additional\n"
 "argument for the above supposition.  And how nobly it raises our\n"
 "conceit of the mighty, misty\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " monster, to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm\n"
 "tropical sea; his vast, mild head overhung by a canopy of vapor,\n"
 "engendered by his incommunicable contemplations, and that vapor - as\n"
 "you will sometimes see it - glorified by a rainbow, as if Heaven\n"
 "itself had put its seal upon his thoughts. For, d'ye see, rainbows do\n"
 "not visit the clear air; they only irradiate vapor. And so, through\n"
 "all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind, divine intuitions\n"
 "now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray. And for\n"
 "this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny; but doubts or\n"
 "denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts of all things\n"
 "earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this combination\n"
 "makes neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who regards them\n"
 "both with equal eye.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the\n"
 "antelope, and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less\n"
 "celestial, I celebrate a tail.  Reckoning the largest sized Sperm\n"
 "Whale's tail to begin at that point of the trunk where it tapers to\n"
 "about the girth of a man, it comprises upon its upper surface alone,\n"
 "an area of at least fifty square feet. The compact round body of its\n"
 "root expands into two broad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually\n"
 "shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness. At the crotch or\n"
 "junction, these flukes slightly overlap, then sideways recede from\n"
 "each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy between. In no living\n"
 "thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the\n"
 "crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost expansion in the\n"
 "full grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet\n"
 "across.  The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " sinews; but cut into it, and you find that three distinct\n"
 "strata compose it: - upper, middle, and lower. The fibres in the upper\n"
 "and lower layers, are long and horizontal; those of the middle one,\n"
 "very short, and running crosswise between the outside layers. This\n"
 "triune structure, as much as anything else, imparts power to the\n"
 "tail. To the student of old Roman walls, the middle layer will furnish\n"
 "a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles always alternating with\n"
 "the stone in those wonderful relics of the antique, and which\n"
 "undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of the masonry.\n"
 "But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough,\n"
 "the whole bulk of the Leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of\n"
 "muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins\n"
 "and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and\n"
 "largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the confluent\n"
 "measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a\n"
 "point. Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to do\n"
 "it.  Nor does this - its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the\n"
 "graceful flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates\n"
 "through a Titanism of power. On the contrary, those motions derive\n"
 "their most appalling beauty from it. Real strength never impairs\n"
 "beauty or harmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything\n"
 "imposingly beautiful, strength has much to do with the magic. Take\n"
 "away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in\n"
 "the carved Hercules, and its charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman\n"
 "lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe, he was\n"
 "overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man, that seemed as a Roman\n"
 "triumphal arch. When Angelo paints even God the Father in human form,\n"
 "mark what robustness is there. And whatever they may reveal of the\n"
 "divine love in the Son, the soft, curled, hermaphroditical Italian\n"
 "pictures, in which his idea has been most successfully embodied; these\n"
 "pictures, so destitute as they are of all brawniness, hint nothing of\n"
 "any power, but the mere negative, feminine one of submission and\n"
 "endurance, which on all hands it is conceded, form the peculiar\n"
 "practical virtues of his teachings.  Such is the subtle elasticity of\n"
 "the organ I treat of, that\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " whether wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger,\n"
 "whatever be the mood it be in, its flexions are invariably marked by\n"
 "exceeding grace. Therein no fairy's arm can transcend it.  Five great\n"
 "motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for progression;\n"
 "Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in sweeping; Fourth, in\n"
 "lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.  First: Being horizontal in its\n"
 "position, the Leviathan's tail acts in a different manner from the\n"
 "tails of all other sea creatures. It never wriggles.  In man or fish,\n"
 "wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the whale, his tail is the sole\n"
 "means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled forwards beneath the body, and\n"
 "then rapidly sprung backwards, it is this which gives that singular\n"
 "darting, leaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming. His\n"
 "side-fins only serve to steer by.  Second: It is a little significant,\n"
 "that while one sperm whale only fights another Sperm Whale with his\n"
 "head and jaw, nevertheless, in his conflicts with man, he chiefly and\n"
 "contemptuously uses his tail. In striking at a boat, he swiftly curves\n"
 "away his flukes from it, and the blow is only inflicted by the\n"
 "recoil. If it be made in the unobstructed air, especially if it\n"
 "descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply irresistible. No ribs\n"
 "of man or boat can withstand it. Your only salvation lies in eluding\n"
 "it; but if it comes sideways through the opposing water, then partly\n"
 "owing to the light buoyancy of the whaleboat, and the elasticity of\n"
 "its materials, a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two, a sort of\n"
 "stitch in the side, is generally the most serious result.  These\n"
 "submerged side blows are so often received in the fishery, that they\n"
 "are accounted mere child's play. Some one strips off a frock, and the\n"
 "hole is stopped.  Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me,\n"
 "that in the whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for\n"
 "in this respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the\n"
 "daintiness of the elephant's trunk. This delicacy is chiefly evinced\n"
 "in the action of sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with\n"
 "a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side\n"
 "upon the surface of the sea; and if he feel but a sailor's whisker,\n"
 "woe to that sailor, whiskers and all.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch! Had this\n"
 "tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of\n"
 "Darmonodes' elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and with\n"
 "low salutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their\n"
 "zones. On more accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale does not\n"
 "possess this prehensile virtue in his tail; for I have heard of yet\n"
 "another elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round his\n"
 "trunk and extracted the dart.  Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the\n"
 "whale in the fancied security of the middle of solitary seas, you find\n"
 "him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity, and kitten-like,\n"
 "he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth. But still you see his\n"
 "power in his play. The broad palms of his tail are flirted high into\n"
 "the air; then smiting the surface, the thunderous concussion resounds\n"
 "for miles. You would almost think a great gun had been discharged; and\n"
 "if you noticed the light wreath of vapor from the spiracle at his\n"
 "other extremity, you would think that that was the smoke from the\n"
 "touch-hole.  Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the\n"
 "Leviathan the flukes lie considerably below the level of his back,\n"
 "they are then completely out of sight beneath the surface; but when he\n"
 "is about to plunge into the deeps, his entire flukes with at least\n"
 "thirty feet of his body are tossed erect in the air, and so remain\n"
 "vibrating a moment, till they downwards shoot out of view. Excepting\n"
 "the sublime breach - somewhere else to be described - this peaking of\n"
 "the whale's flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all\n"
 "animated nature. Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail\n"
 "seems spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven. So in dreams,\n"
 "have I seen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw\n"
 "from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in gazing at such scenes, it is all\n"
 "in all what mood you are in; if in the Dantean, the devils will occur\n"
 "to you; if in that of Isaiah, the archangels. Standing at the\n"
 "mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea, I\n"
 "once saw a large herd of whales in the east, all heading towards the\n"
 "sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes. As it\n"
 "seemed to me at the time, such a grand\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " embodiment of adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in\n"
 "Persia, the home of the fire worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater\n"
 "testified of the African elephant, I then testified of the whale,\n"
 "pronouncing him the most devout of all beings. For according to King\n"
 "Juba, the military elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning\n"
 "with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest silence.  The chance\n"
 "comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the elephant, so far\n"
 "as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other are\n"
 "concerned, should not tend to place those two opposite organs on an\n"
 "equality, much less the creatures to which they respectively\n"
 "belong. For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to Leviathan,\n"
 "so, compared with Leviathan's tail, his trunk is but the stalk of a\n"
 "lily. The most direful blow from the elephant's trunk were as the\n"
 "playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and crash of\n"
 "the Sperm Whale's ponderous flukes, which in repeated instances have\n"
 "one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews\n"
 "into the air, very much as an Indian juggler tosses his balls.  The\n"
 "more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my inability\n"
 "to express it. At times there are gestures in it, which, though they\n"
 "would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly inexplicable. In an\n"
 "extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are these mystic\n"
 "gestures, that I have heard hunters who have declared them akin to\n"
 "Free-Mason signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by these methods\n"
 "intelligently conversed with the world. Nor are there wanting other\n"
 "motions of the whale in his general body, full of strangeness, and\n"
 "unaccountable to his most experienced assailant. Dissect him how I\n"
 "may, then, I but go skin deep; I know him not, and never will. But if\n"
 "I know not even the tail of this whale, how understand his head? much\n"
 "more, how comprehend his face, when face he has none?\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Thou shalt see my back parts, my tail, he seems to say, but\n"
 "my face shall not be seen. But I cannot completely make out his back\n"
 "parts; and hint what he will about his face, I say again he has no\n"
 "face. Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the\n"
 "whale and the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular\n"
 "the elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog\n"
 "does to the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points\n"
 "of curious similitude; among these is the spout. It is well known that\n"
 "the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then\n"
 "elevating it, jet it forth in a stream.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending\n"
 "south-eastward from the territories of Birmah, forms the most\n"
 "southerly point of all Asia. In a continuous line from that peninsula\n"
 "stretch the long islands of Sumatra, Java, Bally, and Timor; which,\n"
 "with many others, form a vast mole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting\n"
 "Asia with Australia, and dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from\n"
 "the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes. This rampart is pierced by\n"
 "several sally-ports for the convenience of ships and whales;\n"
 "conspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and Malacca. By the\n"
 "straits of Sunda, chiefly, vessels bound to China from the west,\n"
 "emerge into the China seas.  Those narrow straits of Sunda divide\n"
 "Sumatra from Java; and standing midway in that vast rampart of\n"
 "islands, buttressed by that bold green promontory, known to seamen as\n"
 "Java Head; they not a little correspond to the central gateway opening\n"
 "into some vast walled empire: and considering the inexhaustible wealth\n"
 "of spices, and silks, and jewels, and gold, and ivory, with which the\n"
 "thousand islands of that oriental sea are enriched, it seems a\n"
 "significant provision of nature, that such treasures, by the very\n"
 "formation of the land, should at least bear the appearance, however\n"
 "ineffectual, of being guarded from the all-grasping western world. The\n"
 "shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with those domineering\n"
 "fortresses which guard the entrances to the Mediterranean, the Baltic,\n"
 "and the Propontis. Unlike the Danes, these Orientals do not demand the\n"
 "obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from the endless procession of\n"
 "ships\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " before the wind, which for centuries past, by night and by\n"
 "day, have passed between the islands of Sumatra and Java, freighted\n"
 "with the costliest cargoes of the east. But while they freely waive a\n"
 "ceremonial like this, they do by no means renounce their claim to more\n"
 "solid tribute.  Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays,\n"
 "lurking among the low shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied\n"
 "out upon the vessels sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding\n"
 "tribute at the point of their spears. Though by the repeated bloody\n"
 "chastisements they have received at the hands of European cruisers,\n"
 "the audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed;\n"
 "yet, even at the present day, we occasionally hear of English and\n"
 "American vessels, which, in those waters, have been remorselessly\n"
 "boarded and pillaged.  With a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now\n"
 "drawing nigh to these straits; Ahab purposing to pass through them\n"
 "into the Javan sea, and thence, cruising northwards, over waters known\n"
 "to be frequented here and there by the Sperm whale, sweep inshore by\n"
 "the Philippine Islands, and gain the far coast of Japan, in time for\n"
 "the great whaling season there. By these means, the circumnavigating\n"
 "Pequod would sweep almost all the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds\n"
 "of the world, previous to descending upon the Line in the Pacific;\n"
 "where Ahab, though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit, firmly\n"
 "counted upon giving battle to Moby Dick, in the sea he was most known\n"
 "to frequent; and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed\n"
 "to be haunting it.  But how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch\n"
 "no land? does his crew drink air? Surely, he will stop for\n"
 "water. Nay. For a long time, now, the circus-running sun has raced\n"
 "within his fiery ring, and needs no sustenance but what's in\n"
 "himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the whaler. While other hulls are\n"
 "loaded down with alien stuff, to be transferred to foreign wharves;\n"
 "the world-wandering whale-ship carries no cargo but herself and crew,\n"
 "their weapons and their wants. She has a whole lake's contents bottled\n"
 "in her ample hold. She is ballasted with utilities; not altogether\n"
 "with unusable pig-lead and kentledge. She carries years' water in\n"
 "her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which, when three years afloat,\n"
 "the Nantucketer,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " in the Pacific, prefers to drink before the brackish fluid,\n"
 "but yesterday rafted off in casks, from the Peruvian or Indian\n"
 "streams. Hence it is, that, while other ships may have gone to China\n"
 "from New York, and back again, touching at a score of ports, the\n"
 "whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have sighted one grain of\n"
 "soil; her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves.\n"
 "So that did you carry them the news that another flood had come; they\n"
 "would only answer - \"Well, boys, here's the ark!\"  Now, as many Sperm\n"
 "Whales had been captured off the western coast of Java, in the near\n"
 "vicinity of the straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of the ground,\n"
 "roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an excellent\n"
 "spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more and more upon\n"
 "Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and admonished to\n"
 "keep wide awake. But though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon\n"
 "loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils the fresh\n"
 "cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was\n"
 "descried. Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game\n"
 "hereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when the\n"
 "customary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle\n"
 "of singular magnificence saluted us.  But here be it premised, that\n"
 "owing to the unwearied activity with which of late they have been\n"
 "hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm Whales, instead of almost\n"
 "invariably sailing in small detached companies, as in former times,\n"
 "are now frequently met with in extensive herds, sometimes embracing so\n"
 "great a multitude, that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of\n"
 "them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and\n"
 "protection. To this aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense\n"
 "caravans, may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best\n"
 "cruising grounds, you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months\n"
 "together, without being greeted by a single spout; and then be\n"
 "suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands.\n"
 "Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and\n"
 "forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon, a\n"
 "continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the\n"
 "noon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " twin-jets of the Right Whale, which, dividing at top, falls\n"
 "over in two branches, like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow, the\n"
 "single forward-slanting spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick\n"
 "curled bush of white mist, continually rising and falling away to\n"
 "leeward.  Seen from the Pequod's deck, then, as she would rise on a\n"
 "high hill of the sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually curling\n"
 "up into the air, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish\n"
 "haze, showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense\n"
 "metropolis, descried of a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on\n"
 "a height.  As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the\n"
 "mountains, accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that\n"
 "perilous passage in their rear, and once more expand in comparative\n"
 "security upon the plain; even so did this vast fleet of whales now\n"
 "seem hurrying forward through the straits; gradually contracting the\n"
 "wings of their semicircle, and swimming on, in one solid, but still\n"
 "crescentic centre.  Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them;\n"
 "the harpooneers handling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the\n"
 "heads of their yet suspended boats. If the wind only held, little\n"
 "doubt had they, that chased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast\n"
 "host would only deploy into the Oriental seas to witness the capture\n"
 "of not a few of their number. And who could tell whether, in that\n"
 "congregated caravan, Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be\n"
 "swimming, like the worshipped white-elephant in the coronation\n"
 "procession of the Siamese! So with stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we\n"
 "sailed along, driving these Leviathans before us; when, of a sudden,\n"
 "the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly directing attention to\n"
 "something in our wake.  Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we\n"
 "beheld another in our rear. It seemed formed of detached white vapors,\n"
 "rising and falling something like the spouts of the whales; only they\n"
 "did not so completely come and go; for they constantly hovered,\n"
 "without finally disappearing. Levelling his glass at this sight, Ahab\n"
 "quickly revolved in his pivot-hole, crying, \"Aloft there, and rig\n"
 "whips and buckets to wet the sails; - Malays, sir, and after us!\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " As if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod\n"
 "should fairly have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were\n"
 "now in hot pursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay. But when\n"
 "the swift Pequod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase;\n"
 "how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her\n"
 "on to her own chosen pursuit, - mere riding-whips and rowels to her,\n"
 "that they were. As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the\n"
 "deck; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the\n"
 "after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him; some such fancy as the\n"
 "above seemed his. And when he glanced upon the green walls of the\n"
 "watery defile in which the ship was then sailing, and bethought him\n"
 "that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance, and beheld, how\n"
 "that through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased\n"
 "to his deadly end; and not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild\n"
 "pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on\n"
 "with their curses; - when all these conceits had passed through his\n"
 "brain, Ahab's brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand\n"
 "beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being able\n"
 "to drag the firm thing from its place.  But thoughts like these\n"
 "troubled very few of the reckless crew; and when, after steadily\n"
 "dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the Pequod at last shot by\n"
 "the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra side, emerging at last\n"
 "upon the broad waters beyond; then, the harpooneers seemed more to\n"
 "grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship, than to\n"
 "rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the Malays. But\n"
 "still driving on in the wake of the whales, at length they seemed\n"
 "abating their speed; gradually the ship neared them; and the wind now\n"
 "dying away, word was passed to spring to the boats. But no sooner did\n"
 "the herd, by some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale,\n"
 "become notified of the three keels that were after them, - though as\n"
 "yet a mile in their rear, - than they rallied again, and forming in\n"
 "close ranks and battalions, so that their spouts all looked like\n"
 "flashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.\n"
 "Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " and after several hours' pulling were almost disposed to\n"
 "renounce the chase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales\n"
 "gave animating token that they were now at last under the influence of\n"
 "that strange perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the\n"
 "fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say he is gallied. The\n"
 "compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and\n"
 "steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout; and\n"
 "like King Porus' elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they\n"
 "seemed going mad with consternation. In all directions expanding in\n"
 "vast irregular circles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by\n"
 "their short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction\n"
 "of panic. This was still more strangely evinced by those of their\n"
 "number, who, completely paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like\n"
 "water-logged dismantled ships on the sea. Had these Leviathans been\n"
 "but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce\n"
 "wolves, they could not possibly have evinced such excessive\n"
 "dismay. But this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all\n"
 "herding creatures.  Though banding together in tens of thousands, the\n"
 "lion-maned buffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary\n"
 "horseman. Witness, too, all human beings, how when herded together in\n"
 "the sheepfold of a theatre's pit, they will, at the slightest alarm of\n"
 "fire, rush helter- skelter for the outlets, crowding, trampling,\n"
 "jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death. Best,\n"
 "therefore, withhold\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us, for\n"
 "there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely\n"
 "outdone by the madness of men.  Though many of the whales, as has been\n"
 "said, were in violent motion, yet it is to be observed that as a whole\n"
 "the herd neither advanced nor retreated, but collectively remained in\n"
 "one place. As is customary in those cases, the boats at once\n"
 "separated, each making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the\n"
 "shoal. In about three minutes' time, Queequeg's harpoon was flung; the\n"
 "stricken fish darted blinding spray in our faces, and then running\n"
 "away with us like light, steered straight for the heart of the\n"
 "herd. Though such a movement on the part of the whale struck under\n"
 "such circumstances, is in no wise unprecedented; and indeed is almost\n"
 "always more or less anticipated; yet does it present one of the more\n"
 "perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. For as the swift monster drags\n"
 "you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to\n"
 "circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb.  As, blind and\n"
 "deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of speed to rid\n"
 "himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we thus tore a\n"
 "white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by the crazed\n"
 "creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was like a ship\n"
 "mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer through their\n"
 "complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what moment it may be\n"
 "locked in and crushed.  But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us\n"
 "manfully; now sheering off from this monster directly across our route\n"
 "in advance; now edging away from that, whose colossal flukes were\n"
 "suspended overhead, while all the time, Starbuck stood up in the bows,\n"
 "lance in hand, pricking out of our way whatever whales he could reach\n"
 "by short darts, for there was no time to make long ones. Nor were the\n"
 "oarsmen quite idle, though their wonted duty was now altogether\n"
 "dispensed with.  They chiefly attended to the shouting part of the\n"
 "business. \"Out of the way, Commodore!\" cried one, to a great dromedary\n"
 "that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface, and for an instant\n"
 "threatened to swamp us. \"Hard down with your tail, there!\" cried a\n"
 "second\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly\n"
 "cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity.  All whaleboats carry\n"
 "certain curious contrivances, originally invented by the Nantucket\n"
 "Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of equal size are\n"
 "stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each other's grain at\n"
 "right angles; a line of considerable length is then attached to the\n"
 "middle of this block, and the other end of the line being looped, it\n"
 "can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is chiefly among gallied\n"
 "whales that this drugg is used. For then, more whales are close round\n"
 "you than you can possibly chase at one time. But Sperm Whales are not\n"
 "every day encountered; while you may, then, you must kill all you\n"
 "can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you must wing them, so\n"
 "that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it is, that\n"
 "at times like these the drugg comes into requisition. Our boat was\n"
 "furnished with three of them. The first and second were successfully\n"
 "darted, and we saw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by\n"
 "the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg. They were\n"
 "cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball. But upon flinging\n"
 "the third, in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it\n"
 "caught under one of the seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it\n"
 "out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the boat's bottom as\n"
 "the seat slid from under him. On both sides the sea came in at the\n"
 "wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in, and\n"
 "so stopped the leaks for the time.  It had been next to impossible to\n"
 "dart these drugged-harpoons, were it not that as we advanced into the\n"
 "herd, our whale's way greatly diminished; moreover, that as we went\n"
 "still further and further from the circumference of commotion, the\n"
 "direful disorders seemed waning. So that when at last the jerking\n"
 "harpoon drew out, and the towing whale sideways vanished; then, with\n"
 "the tapering force of his parting momentum, we glided between two\n"
 "whales into the innermost heart of the shoal, as if from some mountain\n"
 "torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake. Here the storms in the\n"
 "roaring glens between the outermost whales, were heard but not\n"
 "felt. In this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satin-like\n"
 "surface, called a sleek, produced\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more\n"
 "quiet moods. Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say\n"
 "lurks at the heart of every commotion. And still in the distracted\n"
 "distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and\n"
 "saw successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going\n"
 "round and round, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so\n"
 "closely shoulder to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily\n"
 "have over-arched the middle ones, and so have gone round on their\n"
 "backs. Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales, more\n"
 "immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd, no possible\n"
 "chance of escape was at present afforded us. We must watch for a\n"
 "breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall that had only\n"
 "admitted us in order to shut us up. Keeping at the centre of the lake,\n"
 "we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves; the women\n"
 "and children of this routed host.  Now, inclusive of the occasional\n"
 "wide intervals between the revolving outer circles, and inclusive of\n"
 "the spaces between the various pods in any one of those circles, the\n"
 "entire area at this juncture, embraced by the whole multitude, must\n"
 "have contained at least two or three square miles. At any rate -\n"
 "though indeed such a test at such a time might be deceptive -\n"
 "spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up\n"
 "almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention this circumstance,\n"
 "because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked up in\n"
 "this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd had\n"
 "hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its\n"
 "stopping; or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way\n"
 "innocent and inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller\n"
 "whales - now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of\n"
 "the lake - evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a\n"
 "still becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like\n"
 "household dogs they came snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales,\n"
 "and touching them; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly\n"
 "domesticated them. Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched\n"
 "their backs with his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the\n"
 "time refrained from darting it.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another\n"
 "and still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For,\n"
 "suspended in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing\n"
 "mothers of the whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed\n"
 "shortly to become mothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a\n"
 "considerable depth exceedingly transparent; and as human infants while\n"
 "suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if\n"
 "leading two different lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal\n"
 "nourishment, be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly\n"
 "reminiscence; - even so did the young of these whales seem looking up\n"
 "towards us, but not at us, as if we were but a bit of Gulf-weed in\n"
 "their new-born sight. floating on their sides, the mothers also seemed\n"
 "quietly eyeing us. One of these little infants, that from certain\n"
 "queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might have measured some\n"
 "fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in girth. He was a little\n"
 "frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that\n"
 "irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal reticule;\n"
 "where, tail to head, and all ready for the final spring, the unborn\n"
 "whale lies bent like a Tartar's bow. The delicate side- fins, and the\n"
 "palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the plaited crumpled\n"
 "appearance of a baby's ears newly arrived from foreign parts.  \"Line!\n"
 "line!\" cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; \"him fast! him fast!\n"
 "- Who line him! Who struck? Two whale; one big, one little!\"  \"What\n"
 "ails ye, man?\" cried Starbuck.  \"Look-e here,\" said Queequeg pointing\n"
 "down.  As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out\n"
 "hundreds of fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up\n"
 "again, and shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and\n"
 "spiralling towards the air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the\n"
 "umbilical cord of Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed\n"
 "still tethered to its dam. Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the\n"
 "chase, this natural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes\n"
 "entangled with the hempen one, so that the cub is thereby\n"
 "trapped. Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We saw young\n"
 "Leviathan amours in the deep.  And thus, though surrounded by circle\n"
 "upon circle of consternations and affrights, did these inscrutable\n"
 "creatures at the centre freely and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful\n"
 "concernments; yea, serenely revelled in dalliance and delight. But\n"
 "even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of my being, do I myself still\n"
 "for ever centrally disport in mute calm; and while ponderous planets\n"
 "of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down and deep inland there i\n"
 "still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.  Meanwhile, as we thus lay\n"
 "entranced, the occasional sudden frantic spectacles in the distance\n"
 "evinced the activity of the other boats, still engaged in drugging the\n"
 "whales on the frontier of the host; or possibly carrying on the war\n"
 "within the first circle, where abundance of room and some convenient\n"
 "retreats were afforded them. But the sight of the enraged drugged\n"
 "whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles, was\n"
 "nothing to what at last met our eyes.  It is sometimes the custom when\n"
 "fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert, to seek to\n"
 "hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or maiming his gigantic\n"
 "tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled cutting-spade, to\n"
 "which is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A whale wounded\n"
 "(as we afterwards learned) in this part, but not effectually, as it\n"
 "seemed, had broken away from the boat, carrying along with him half of\n"
 "the harpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony of the wound, he was\n"
 "now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone mounted\n"
 "desperado\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Arnold, at the battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay wherever\n"
 "he went.  But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an\n"
 "appalling spectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with\n"
 "which he seemed to inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause\n"
 "which at first the intervening distance obscured from us. But at\n"
 "length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the\n"
 "fishery, this whale had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he\n"
 "towed; he had also run away with the cutting-spade in him; and while\n"
 "the free end of the rope attached to that weapon, had permanently\n"
 "caught in the coils of the harpoon-line round his tail, the\n"
 "cutting-spade itself had worked loose from his flesh. So that\n"
 "tormented to madness, he was now churning through the water, violently\n"
 "flailing with his flexible tail, and tossing the keen spade about him,\n"
 "wounding and murdering his own comrades.  This terrific object seemed\n"
 "to recall the whole herd from their stationary fright. First, the\n"
 "whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a little, and\n"
 "tumble against each other, as if lifted by half spent billows from\n"
 "afar; then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell; the\n"
 "submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished; in more and more\n"
 "contracting orbits the whales in the more central circles began to\n"
 "swim in thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm was departing. A low\n"
 "advancing hum was soon heard; and then like to the tumultuous masses\n"
 "of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in Spring, the\n"
 "entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre, as if to\n"
 "pile themselves up in one common mountain. Instantly Starbuck and\n"
 "Queequeg changed places; Starbuck taking the stern.  \"Oars! Oars!\" he\n"
 "intensely whispered, seizing the helm - \"gripe your oars, and clutch\n"
 "your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! Shove him off, you Queequeg -\n"
 "the whale there! - prick him! - hit him! Stand up - stand up, and stay\n"
 "so! Spring, men - pull, men; never mind their backs - scrape them! -\n"
 "scrape away!\"  The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black\n"
 "bulks, leaving a narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths. But by\n"
 "desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " opening; then giving way rapidly, and at the same time\n"
 "earnestly watching for another outlet. After many similar hair-breadth\n"
 "escapes, we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the\n"
 "outer circles, but now crossed by random whales, all violently making\n"
 "for one centre. This lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss\n"
 "of Queequeg's hat, who, while standing in the bows to prick the\n"
 "fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his head by the air-eddy\n"
 "made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by.\n"
 "Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon\n"
 "resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having\n"
 "clumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their\n"
 "onward flight with augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless;\n"
 "but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged\n"
 "whales might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which Flask\n"
 "had killed and waifed. The waif is a pennoned pole, two or three of\n"
 "which are carried by every boat; and which, when additional game is at\n"
 "hand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale,\n"
 "both to mark its place on the sea, and also as token of prior\n"
 "possession, should the boats of any other ship draw near.  The result\n"
 "of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious saying in\n"
 "the Fishery, - the more whales the less fish. Of all the drugged\n"
 "whales only one was captured. The rest contrived to escape for the\n"
 "time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen, by some other\n"
 "craft than the Pequod. To gally, or gallow, is to frighten excessively\n"
 "- to confound with fright. It is an old Saxon word. It occurs once in\n"
 "Shakespeare: - The wrathful skies Gallow the very wanderers of the\n"
 "dark And make them keep their caves. To common language, the word is\n"
 "now completely obsolete. When the polite landsman first hears it from\n"
 "the gaunt Nantucketer, he is apt to set it down as one of the\n"
 "whaleman's self-derived savageries. Much the same is it with many\n"
 "other sinewy Saxonisms of this sort, which emigrated to New-England\n"
 "rocks with the noble brawn of the old English emigrants in the time of\n"
 "the Commonwealth. Thus, some of the best and furthest-descended\n"
 "English words - the etymological Howards and Percys - are now\n"
 "democratised, nay, plebeianised - so to speak - in the New World. The\n"
 "Sperm Whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but unlike\n"
 "most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a\n"
 "gestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but\n"
 "one at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an\n"
 "Esau and Jacob: - a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats,\n"
 "curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts\n"
 "themselves extend upwards from that. When by chance these precious\n"
 "parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter's lance, the mother's\n"
 "pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolor the sea for rods. The milk\n"
 "is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well\n"
 "with strawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales\n"
 "salute more hominum.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd\n"
 "of Sperm Whales, and there was also then given the probable cause\n"
 "inducing those vast aggregations.  Now, though such great bodies are\n"
 "at times encountered, yet,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " as must have been seen, even at the present day, small\n"
 "detached bands are occasionally observed, embracing from twenty to\n"
 "fifty individuals each. Such bands are known as schools. They\n"
 "generally are of two sorts; those composed almost entirely of females,\n"
 "and those mustering none but young vigorous males, or bulls, as they\n"
 "are familiarly designated.  In cavalier attendance upon the school of\n"
 "females, you invariably see a male of full grown magnitude, but not\n"
 "old; who, upon any alarm, evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear\n"
 "and covering the flight of his ladies. In truth, this gentleman is a\n"
 "luxurious Ottoman, swimming about over the watery world, surroundingly\n"
 "accompanied by all the solaces and endearments of the harem. The\n"
 "contrast between this Ottoman and his concubines is striking; because,\n"
 "while he is always of the largest Leviathanic proportions, the ladies,\n"
 "even at full growth, are not more than one third of the bulk of an\n"
 "average-sized male. They are comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare\n"
 "say, not to exceed half a dozen yards round the waist. Nevertheless,\n"
 "it cannot be denied, that upon the whole they are hereditarily\n"
 "entitled to en bon point.  It is very curious to watch this harem and\n"
 "its lord in their indolent ramblings.  Like fashionables, they are for\n"
 "ever on the move in leisurely search of variety.  You meet them on the\n"
 "Line in time for the full flower of the Equatorial feeding season,\n"
 "having just returned, perhaps, from spending the summer in the\n"
 "Northern seas, and so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and\n"
 "warmth. By the time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the\n"
 "Equator awhile, they start for the Oriental waters in anticipation of\n"
 "the cool season there, and so evade the other excessive temperature of\n"
 "the year.  When serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any\n"
 "strange suspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on\n"
 "his interesting family.  Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan\n"
 "coming that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the\n"
 "ladies, with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases\n"
 "him away! High times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him are\n"
 "to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though do\n"
 "what the Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " of his bed; for, alas! all fish bed in common. As ashore, the\n"
 "ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers;\n"
 "just so with the whales, who sometimes come to deadly battle, and all\n"
 "for love. They fence with their long lower jaws, sometimes locking\n"
 "them together, and so striving for the supremacy like elks that\n"
 "warringly interweave their antlers. Not a few are captured having the\n"
 "deep scars of these encounters, - furrowed heads, broken teeth,\n"
 "scolloped fins; and in some instances, wrenched and dislocated mouths.\n"
 "But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at\n"
 "the first rush of the harem's lord, then is it very diverting to watch\n"
 "that lord. Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and\n"
 "revels there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario,\n"
 "like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand\n"
 "concubines. Granting other whales to be in sight, the fishermen will\n"
 "seldom give chase to one of these Grand Turks; for these Grand Turks\n"
 "are too lavish of their strength, and hence their unctuousness is\n"
 "small.  As for the sons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons\n"
 "and daughters must take care of themselves; at least, with only the\n"
 "maternal help. For like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that\n"
 "might be named, my Lord Whale has no taste for the nursery, however\n"
 "much for the bower; and so, being a great traveller, he leaves his\n"
 "anonymous babies all over the world; every baby an exotic. In good\n"
 "time, nevertheless, as the ardor of youth declines; as years and dumps\n"
 "increase; as reflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a\n"
 "general lassitude overtakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and\n"
 "virtue supplants the love for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the\n"
 "impotent, repentant, admonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands the\n"
 "harem, and grown to an exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all alone\n"
 "among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers, and warning each\n"
 "young Leviathan from his amorous errors.  Now, as the harem of whales\n"
 "is called by the fishermen a school, so is the lord and master of that\n"
 "school technically known as the schoolmaster. It is therefore not in\n"
 "strict character, however admirably satirical, that after going to\n"
 "school himself, he should then go abroad inculcating not what he\n"
 "learned there, but the folly of it. His title, schoolmaster, would\n"
 "very naturally\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself,\n"
 "but some have surmised that the man who first thus entitled this sort\n"
 "of Ottoman whale, must have read the memoirs of Vidocq, and informed\n"
 "himself what sort of a country-schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was\n"
 "in his younger days, and what was the nature of those occult lessons\n"
 "he inculcated into some of his pupils.  The same secludedness and\n"
 "isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes himself in his\n"
 "advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm Whales. Almost universally,\n"
 "a lone whale - as a solitary Leviathan is called - proves an ancient\n"
 "one. Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel Boone, he will have no one\n"
 "near him but Nature herself; and her he takes to wife in the\n"
 "wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she is, though she keeps\n"
 "so many moody secrets.  The schools composing none but young and\n"
 "vigorous males, previously mentioned, offer a strong contrast to the\n"
 "harem schools. For while those female whales are characteristically\n"
 "timid, the young males, or forty-barrel-bulls, as they call them, are\n"
 "by far the most pugnacious of all Leviathans, and proverbially the\n"
 "most dangerous to encounter; excepting those wondrous grey-headed,\n"
 "grizzled whales, sometimes met, and these will fight you like grim\n"
 "fiends exasperated by a penal gout.  The Forty-barrel-bull schools are\n"
 "larger than the harem schools. Like a mob of young collegians, they\n"
 "are full of fight, fun, and wickedness, tumbling round the world at\n"
 "such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no prudent underwriter would\n"
 "insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at Yale or\n"
 "Harvard. They soon relinquish this turbulence though, and when about\n"
 "three fourths grown, break up, and separately go about in quest of\n"
 "settlements, that is, harems.  Another point of difference between the\n"
 "male and female schools is still more characteristic of the sexes. Say\n"
 "you strike a Forty-barrel-bull - poor devil!  all his comrades quit\n"
 "him. But strike a member of the harem school, and her companions swim\n"
 "around her with every token of concern, sometimes lingering so near\n"
 "her and so long, as themselves to fall a prey.\n"

 " The allusion to the waifs and waif-poles in the last chapter\n"
 "but one, necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the\n"
 "whale fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and\n"
 "badge.  It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in\n"
 "company, a whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be\n"
 "finally killed and captured by another vessel; and herein are\n"
 "indirectly comprised many minor contingencies, all partaking of this\n"
 "one grand feature. For example, - after a weary and perilous chase and\n"
 "capture of a whale, the body may get loose from the ship by reason of\n"
 "a violent storm; and drifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a\n"
 "second whaler, who, in a calm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk\n"
 "of life or line. Thus the most vexatious and violent disputes would\n"
 "often arise between the fishermen, were there not some written or\n"
 "unwritten, universal, undisputed law applicable to all cases.  Perhaps\n"
 "the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment, was\n"
 "that of Holland. It was decreed by the States-General in A. D. 1695\n"
 ". But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law, yet\n"
 "the American fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in\n"
 "this matter. They have provided a system which for terse\n"
 "comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian's Pandects and the By-laws of\n"
 "the Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling with other\n"
 "People's Business. Yes; these laws might be engraven on a Queen Anne's\n"
 "farthing, or the barb of a harpoon, and worn round the neck, so small\n"
 "are they.  I. A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.  II. A\n"
 "Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.  But\n"
 "what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " admirable brevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of\n"
 "commentaries to expound it.  First: What is a Fast- Fish? Alive or\n"
 "dead a fish is technically fast, when it is connected with an occupied\n"
 "ship or boat, by any medium at all controllable by the occupant or\n"
 "occupants, - a mast, an oar, a nine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a\n"
 "strand of cobweb, it is all the same. Likewise a fish is technically\n"
 "fast when it bears a waif, or any other recognised symbol of\n"
 "possession; so long as the party waifing it plainly evince their\n"
 "ability at any time to take it alongside, as well as their intention\n"
 "so to do.  These are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of\n"
 "the whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder\n"
 "knocks - the Coke-upon-Littleton of the fist. True, among the more\n"
 "upright and honorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar\n"
 "cases, where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party\n"
 "to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another\n"
 "party. But others are by no means so scrupulous.  Some fifty years ago\n"
 "there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated in England, wherein\n"
 "the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the\n"
 "Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had succeeded in\n"
 "harpooning the fish; they were at last, through peril of their lives,\n"
 "obliged to forsake not only their lines, but their boat\n"
 "itself. Ultimately the defendants (the crew of another ship) came up\n"
 "with the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally appropriated it\n"
 "before the very eyes of the plaintiffs. And when those defendants were\n"
 "remonstrated with, their captain snapped his fingers in the\n"
 "plaintiffs' teeth, and assured them that by way of doxology to the\n"
 "deed he had done, he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat,\n"
 "which had remained attached to the whale at the time of the\n"
 "seizure. Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the\n"
 "value of their whale, line, harpoons, and boat.  Mr. Erskine was\n"
 "counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the judge. In the\n"
 "course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to illustrate his\n"
 "position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case, wherein a\n"
 "gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife's viciousness, had\n"
 "at last abandoned her upon\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the seas of life; but in the course of years, repenting of\n"
 "that step, he instituted an action to recover possession of\n"
 "her. Erskine was on the other side; and he then supported it by\n"
 "saying, that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady,\n"
 "and had once had her fast, and only by reason of the great stress of\n"
 "her plunging viciousness, had as last abandoned her; yet abandon her\n"
 "he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and therefore when a\n"
 "subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then became that\n"
 "subsequent gentleman's property, along with whatever harpoon might\n"
 "have been found sticking in her.  Now in the present case Erskine\n"
 "contended that the examples of the whale and the lady were\n"
 "reciprocally illustrative of each other.  These pleadings, and the\n"
 "counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very learned judge in set\n"
 "terms decided, to wit, - That as for the boat, he awarded it to the\n"
 "plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives;\n"
 "but that with regard to the controverted whale, harpoons, and line,\n"
 "they belonged to the defendants; the whale, because it was a\n"
 "Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons and line\n"
 "because when the fish made off with them, it (the fish) acquired a\n"
 "property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards took the\n"
 "fish had a right to them. Now the defendants afterwards took the fish;\n"
 "ergo, the aforesaid articles were theirs.  A common man looking at\n"
 "this decision of the very learned Judge, might possibly object to\n"
 "it. But ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter, the two great\n"
 "principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously quoted, and\n"
 "applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in the above cited case;\n"
 "these two laws touching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish, I say, will, on\n"
 "reflection, be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence; For\n"
 "notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture, the Temple of\n"
 "the Law, like the Temple of the Philistines, has but two props to\n"
 "stand on.  Is it not a saying in every one's mouth, Possession is half\n"
 "of the law: that is, regardless of how the thing came into possession?\n"
 "But often possession is the whole of the law. What are the sinews and\n"
 "souls of Russian serfs and Republican slaves\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " but Fast-Fish, whereof possession is the whole of the law?\n"
 "What to the rapacious landlord is the widow's last mite but a\n"
 "Fast-Fish? What is yonder undetected villain's marble mansion with a\n"
 "door- plate for a waif; what is that but a Fast-Fish? What is the\n"
 "ruinous discount which Mordecai, the broker, gets from poor Woebegone,\n"
 "the bankrupt, on a loan to keep Woebegone's family from starvation;\n"
 "what is that ruinous discount but a Fast-Fish? What is the archbishop\n"
 "of Savesoul's income of lb. 100,000 seized from the scant bread and\n"
 "cheese of hundreds of thousands of broken- backed laborers (all sure\n"
 "of heaven without any of Savesoul's help) what is that globular\n"
 "100,000 but a Fast-Fish?  What are the Duke of Dunder's hereditary\n"
 "towns and hamlets but Fast-Fish? What to that redoubted harpooneer,\n"
 "John Bull, is poor Ireland, but a Fast-Fish? What to that apostolic\n"
 "lancer, Brother Jonathan, is Texas but a Fast-Fish? And concerning all\n"
 "these, is not Possession the whole of the law?  But if the doctrine of\n"
 "Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable, the kindred doctrine of\n"
 "Loose-Fish is still more widely so. That is internationally and\n"
 "universally applicable.  What was America in 1492 but a loose-fish, in\n"
 "which Columbus struck the Spanish standard by way of waifing it for\n"
 "his royal master and mistress? What was Poland to the Czar? What\n"
 "Greece to the Turk? What India to England? What at last will Mexico be\n"
 "to the United States? All Loose-Fish.  What are the Rights of Man and\n"
 "the Liberties of the World but Loose-Fish? What all men's minds and\n"
 "opinions but Loose-Fish? What is the principle of religious belief in\n"
 "them but a Loose-Fish? What to the ostentatious smuggling verbalists\n"
 "are the thoughts of thinkers but Loose-Fish? What is the great globe\n"
 "itself but a Loose-Fish? And what are you, reader, but a Loose-Fish\n"
 "and a Fast-Fish, too?\n"

 "captured by anybody on the coast of that land, the King, as Honorary\n"
 "Grand Harpooneer, must have the head, and the Queen be respectfully\n"
 "presented with the tail. A division which, in the whale, is much like\n"
 "halving an apple; there is no intermediate remainder. Now as this law,\n"
 "under a modified form, is to this day in force in England; and as it\n"
 "offers in various respects a strange anomaly touching the general law\n"
 "of Fast and Loose-Fish, it is here treated of in a separate chapter,\n"
 "on the same courteous principle that prompts the English railways to\n"
 "be at the expense of a separate car, specially reserved for the\n"
 "accommodation of royalty. In the first place, in curious proof of the\n"
 "fact that the above- mentioned law is still in force, I proceed to lay\n"
 "before you a circumstance that happened within the last two years.  It\n"
 "seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one of\n"
 "the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and\n"
 "beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from\n"
 "the shore. Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the\n"
 "jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord\n"
 "Warden. Holding the office directly from the crown, I believe, all the\n"
 "royal emoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become by\n"
 "assignment his. By some writers this office is called a sinecure. But\n"
 "not so.  Because the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in\n"
 "fobbing his perquisites; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same\n"
 "fobbing of them.  Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-\n"
 "footed, and\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " with their trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had\n"
 "wearily hauled their fat fish high and dry, promising themselves a\n"
 "good 150 pounds from the precious oil and bone; and in fantasy sipping\n"
 "rare tea with their wives, and good ale with their cronies, upon the\n"
 "strength of their respective shares; up steps a very learned and most\n"
 "Christian and charitable gentleman, with a copy of Blackstone under\n"
 "his arm; and laying it upon the whale's head, he says - \"Hands off!\n"
 "this fish, my masters, is a Fast-Fish. I seize it as the Lord\n"
 "Warden's\".  Upon this the poor mariners in their respectful\n"
 "consternation - so truly English - knowing not what to say, fall to\n"
 "vigorously scratching their heads all round; meanwhile ruefully\n"
 "glancing from the whale to the stranger. But that did in nowise mend\n"
 "the matter, or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman\n"
 "with the copy of Blackstone. At length one of them, after long\n"
 "scratching about for his ideas, made bold to speak.  \"Please, Sir, who\n"
 "is the Lord Warden?\"  \"The Duke.\"  \"But the duke had nothing to do\n"
 "with taking this fish?\"  \"It is his.\"  \"We have been at great trouble,\n"
 "and peril, and some expense, and is all that to go to the Duke's\n"
 "benefit; we getting nothing at all for our pains but our blisters?\"\n"
 "\"It is his.\"  \"Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this\n"
 "desperate mode of getting a livelihood?\"  \"It is his.\"  \"I thought to\n"
 "relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of this whale.\"\n"
 "\"It is his.\"  \"Won't the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?\"\n"
 "\"It is his.\"  In a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace\n"
 "the Duke of Wellington received the money. Thinking that viewed in\n"
 "some particular lights, the case might by a bare possibility in some\n"
 "small degree be deemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an\n"
 "honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his\n"
 "Grace, begging him to take the case of those unfortunate\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " mariners into full consideration. To which my Lord Duke in\n"
 "substance replied (both letters were published) that he had already\n"
 "done so, and received the money, and would be obliged to the reverend\n"
 "gentleman if for the future he (the reverend gentleman) would decline\n"
 "meddling with other people's business. Is this the still militant old\n"
 "man, standing at the corners of the three kingdoms, on all hands\n"
 "coercing alms of beggars?  It will readily be seen that in this case\n"
 "the alleged right of the Duke to the whale was a delegated one from\n"
 "the Sovereign. We must needs inquire then on what principle the\n"
 "Sovereign is originally invested with that right. The law itself has\n"
 "already been set forth. But Plowdon gives us the reason for it. Says\n"
 "Plowdon, the whale so caught belongs to the King and Queen, \"because\n"
 "of its superior excellence.\" And by the soundest commentators this has\n"
 "ever been held a cogent argument in such matters.  But why should the\n"
 "King have the head, and the Queen the tail? A reason for that, ye\n"
 "lawyers!  In his treatise on \"Queen-Gold\", or Queen-pinmoney, an old\n"
 "King's Bench author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: \"Ye tail is\n"
 "ye Queen's, that ye Queen's wardrobe may be supplied with ye\n"
 "whalebone\". Now this was written at a time when the black limber bone\n"
 "of the Greenland or Right whale was largely used in ladies'\n"
 "bodices. But this same bone is not in the tail; it is in the head,\n"
 "which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like Prynne. But is the\n"
 "Queen a mermaid, to be presented with a tail? An allegorical meaning\n"
 "may lurk here.  There are two royal fish so styled by the English law\n"
 "writers - the whale and the sturgeon; both royal property under\n"
 "certain limitations, and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the\n"
 "crown's ordinary revenue. I know not that any other author has hinted\n"
 "of the matter; but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must\n"
 "be divided in the same way as the whale, the King receiving the highly\n"
 "dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish, which, symbolically\n"
 "regarded, may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed\n"
 "congeniality.  And thus there seems a reason in all things, even in\n"
 "law.\n"

 " \"In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this\n"
 "Leviathan, insufferable fetor denying not inquiry.\" Sir T. Browne,\n"
 "V. E.  It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted,\n"
 "and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea,\n"
 "that the many noses on the Pequod's deck proved more vigilant\n"
 "discoverers than the three pairs of eyes aloft. A peculiar and not\n"
 "very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea.  \"I will bet something now,\"\n"
 "said Stubb, \"that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged\n"
 "whales we tickled the other day. I thought they would keel up before\n"
 "long.\"  Presently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the\n"
 "distance lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of\n"
 "whale must be alongside. As we glided nearer, the stranger showed\n"
 "French colors from his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture\n"
 "sea-fowl that circled, and hovered, and swooped around him, it was\n"
 "plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a\n"
 "blasted whale, that is, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea,\n"
 "and so floated an unappropriated corpse. It may well be conceived,\n"
 "what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale; worse than an Assyrian\n"
 "city in the plague, when the living are incompetent to bury the\n"
 "departed. So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some, that no\n"
 "cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it.  Yet are there\n"
 "those who will still do it; notwithstanding the fact that the oil\n"
 "obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality, and by no\n"
 "means of the nature of attar-of-rose.  Coming still nearer with the\n"
 "expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman had a second whale\n"
 "alongside; and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay than\n"
 "the first. In truth, it turned out to be one of those problematical\n"
 "whales that seem\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia, or\n"
 "indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of\n"
 "anything like oil.  Nevertheless, in the proper place we shall see\n"
 "that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale\n"
 "as this, however much he may shun blasted whales in general.  The\n"
 "Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he\n"
 "recognized his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were\n"
 "knotted round the tail of one of these whales.  \"There's a pretty\n"
 "fellow, now,\" he banteringly laughed, standing in the ship's bows,\n"
 "\"there's a jackal for ye! I well know that these Crappoes of Frenchmen\n"
 "are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering their boats for\n"
 "breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes, and sometimes\n"
 "sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow\n"
 "candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they will\n"
 "get won't be enough to dip the Captain's wick into; aye, we all know\n"
 "these things; but look ye, here's a Crappo that is content with our\n"
 "leavings, the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content too\n"
 "with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has\n"
 "there. Poor devil! I say, pass round a hat, some one, and let's make\n"
 "him a present of a little oil for dear charity's sake. For what oil\n"
 "he'll get from that drugged whale there, wouldn't be fit to burn in a\n"
 "jail; no, not in a condemned cell. And as for the other whale, why,\n"
 "I'll agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three\n"
 "masts of ours, than he'll get from that bundle of bones; though, now\n"
 "that I think of it, it may contain something worth a good deal more\n"
 "than oil; yes, ambergris. I wonder now if our old man has thought of\n"
 "that. It's worth trying. Yes, I'm for it; and so saying he started for\n"
 "the quarter-deck.  By this time the faint air had become a complete\n"
 "calm; so that whether or no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in\n"
 "the smell, with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up\n"
 "again. Issuing from the cabin, Stubb now called his boat's crew, and\n"
 "pulled off for the stranger. Drawing across her bow, he perceived that\n"
 "in accordance with the fanciful French taste, the upper part of her\n"
 "stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for thorns had\n"
 "copper spikes projecting from it here and there; the whole terminating\n"
 "in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red color. Upon her head\n"
 "boards, in large gilt letters, he read \"Bouton de Rose,\" -\n"
 "Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the romantic name of this\n"
 "aromatic ship.  Though Stubb did not understand the Bouton part of the\n"
 "inscription, yet the word rose, and the bulbous figure-head put\n"
 "together, sufficiently explained the whole to him.  \"A wooden\n"
 "rose-bud, eh?\" he cried with his hand to his nose, \"that will do very\n"
 "well; but how like all creation it smells!\"  Now in order to hold\n"
 "direct communication with the people on deck, he had to pull round the\n"
 "bows to the starboard side, and thus come close to the blasted whale;\n"
 "and so talk over it.  Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still\n"
 "to his nose, he bawled - \"Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you\n"
 "Bouton-de-Roses that speak English?\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\"Yes,\" rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be\n"
 "the chief-mate.  \"Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose- bud, have you seen\n"
 "the White Whale?\"  \"What whale?\"  \"The White Whale - a Sperm Whale -\n"
 "Moby Dick, have ye seen him?\"  \"Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot\n"
 "Blanche! White Whale - no.\"  \"Very good, then; good bye now, and I'll\n"
 "call again in a minute.\"  Then rapidly pulling back towards the\n"
 "Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning over the quarter-deck rail awaiting\n"
 "his report, he moulded his two hands into a trumpet and shouted - \"No,\n"
 "Sir! No!\" Upon which Ahab retired, and Stubb returned to the\n"
 "Frenchman.  He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got\n"
 "into the chains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in\n"
 "a sort of bag.  \"What's the matter with your nose, there?\" said\n"
 "Stubb. \"Broke it?\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"I wish it was broken, or that I didn't have any nose at\n"
 "all!\" answered the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he\n"
 "was at very much. \"But what are you holding yours for?\"  \"Oh, nothing!\n"
 "It's a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, aint it? Air rather\n"
 "gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will ye,\n"
 "Bouton-de-Rose?\"  \"What in the devil's name do you want here?\" roared\n"
 "the Guernsey-man, flying into a sudden passion.  \"Oh! keep cool -\n"
 "cool? yes, that's the word; why don't you pack those whales in ice\n"
 "while you're working at 'em? But joking aside, though; do you know,\n"
 "Rose-bud, that it's all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such\n"
 "whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn't a gill in his whole\n"
 "carcase.\"  \"I know that well enough; but, d'ye see, the Captain here\n"
 "won't believe it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne\n"
 "manufacturer before. But come aboard, and mayhap he'll believe you, if\n"
 "he won't me; and so I'll get out of this dirty scrape.\"  \"Anything to\n"
 "oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,\" rejoined Stubb, and with\n"
 "that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene presented\n"
 "itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting\n"
 "the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked rather\n"
 "slow and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good\n"
 "humor. All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so\n"
 "many jib- booms. Now and then pairs of them would drop their work, and\n"
 "run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they\n"
 "would catch the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals\n"
 "held it to their nostrils. Others having broken the stems of their\n"
 "pipes almost short off at the bowl, were vigorously puffing\n"
 "tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly filled their olfactories.  Stubb\n"
 "was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the\n"
 "Captain's round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a fiery\n"
 "face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from\n"
 "within. This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain\n"
 "remonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself\n"
 "to the Captain's round-house ( cabinet he called it) to avoid the\n"
 "pest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and\n"
 "indignations at times.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and\n"
 "turning to the Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which\n"
 "the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a\n"
 "conceited ignoramus, who had brought them all into so unsavory and\n"
 "unprofitable a pickle. Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived\n"
 "that the Guernsey-man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the\n"
 "ambergris. He therefore held his peace on that head, but otherwise was\n"
 "quite frank and confidential with him, so that the two quickly\n"
 "concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the\n"
 "Captain, without his at all dreaming of distrusting their\n"
 "sincerity. According to this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man,\n"
 "under cover of an interpreter's office, was to tell the Captain what\n"
 "he pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and as for Stubb, he was to\n"
 "utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the\n"
 "interview.  By this time their destined victim appeared from his\n"
 "cabin. He was a small and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a\n"
 "sea-captain, with large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a\n"
 "red cotton velvet vest with watch-seals at his side. To this\n"
 "gentleman, Stubb was now politely introduced by the Guernsey-man, who\n"
 "at once ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them.\n"
 "\"What shall I say to him first?\" said he.  \"Why,\" said Stubb, eyeing\n"
 "the velvet vest and the watch and seals, \"you may as well begin by\n"
 "telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me, though I don't\n"
 "pretend to be a judge.\"  \"He says, Monsieur,\" said the Guernsey-man,\n"
 "in French, turning to his captain, \"that only yesterday his ship spoke\n"
 "a vessel, whose captain and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died\n"
 "of a fever caught from a blasted whale they had brought alongside.\"\n"
 "Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.\n"
 "\"What now?\" said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.  \"Why, since he takes it\n"
 "so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him carefully, I'm quite\n"
 "certain that he's no more fit to command a whale-ship than a St. Jago\n"
 "monkey. In fact, tell him from me he's a baboon.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the\n"
 "dried one, is far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur,\n"
 "he conjures us, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.\"\n"
 "Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his\n"
 "crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast\n"
 "loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.  \"What\n"
 "now?\" said the Guernsey-man, when the captain had returned to them.\n"
 "\"Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that - that - in\n"
 "fact, tell him I've diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps\n"
 "somebody else.\"  \"He says, Monsieur, that he's very happy to have been\n"
 "of any service to us.\"  Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were\n"
 "the grateful parties (meaning himself and mate) and concluded by\n"
 "inviting Stubb down into his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.  \"He\n"
 "wants you to take a glass of wine with him,\" said the interpreter.\n"
 "\"Thank him heartily; but tell him it's against my principles to drink\n"
 "with the man I've diddled. In fact, tell him I must go.\"  \"He says,\n"
 "Monsieur, that his principles won't admit of his drinking; but that if\n"
 "Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur had best\n"
 "drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales, for\n"
 "it's so calm they won't drift.\"  By this time Stubb was over the side,\n"
 "and getting into his boat, hailed the Guernsey-man to this effect, -\n"
 "that having a long tow-line in his boat, he would do what he could to\n"
 "help them, by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ship's\n"
 "side. While the Frenchman's boats, then, were engaged in towing the\n"
 "ship one way, Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other\n"
 "way, ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow-line.\n"
 "Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the\n"
 "whale; hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance,\n"
 "while the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb's whale. Whereupon\n"
 "Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " and hailing the pequod to give notice of his intentions, at\n"
 "once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning. Seizing\n"
 "his sharp boat-spade, he commenced an excavation in the body, a little\n"
 "behind the side fin. You would almost have thought he was digging a\n"
 "cellar there in the sea; and when at length his spade struck against\n"
 "the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up old Roman tiles and pottery\n"
 "buried in fat English loam. His boat's crew were all in high\n"
 "excitement, eagerly helping their chief, and looking as anxious as\n"
 "gold-hunters.\n"
 "\n"
 "And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and\n"
 "screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning\n"
 "to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay increased,\n"
 "when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague, there stole a\n"
 "faint stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide of bad smells\n"
 "without being absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then\n"
 "along with another, without at all blending with it for a time.  \"I\n"
 "have it, I have it,\" cried Stubb, with delight, striking something in\n"
 "the subterranean regions, \"a purse! a purse!\"  Dropping his spade, he\n"
 "thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of something that looked\n"
 "like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old cheese; very unctuous and\n"
 "savory withal. You might easily dent it with your thumb; it is of a\n"
 "hue between yellow and ash color. And this, good friends, is\n"
 "ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist. Some six\n"
 "handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably lost in the sea, and\n"
 "still more, perhaps, might have been secured were it not for impatient\n"
 "Ahab's loud command to Stubb to desist, and come on board, else the\n"
 "ship would bid them good bye.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so\n"
 "important as an article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain\n"
 "Nantucket-born\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Captain Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House\n"
 "of Commons on that subject. for at that time, and indeed until a\n"
 "comparatively late day, the precise origin of ambergris remained, like\n"
 "amber itself, a problem to the learned. Though the word ambergris is\n"
 "but the French compound for grey amber, yet the two substances are\n"
 "quite distinct. For amber, though at times found on the sea-coast, is\n"
 "also dug up in some far inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found\n"
 "except upon the sea. Besides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle,\n"
 "odorless substance, used for mouth- pieces to pipes, for beads and\n"
 "ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and\n"
 "spicy, that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious\n"
 "candles, hair-powders, and pomatum. The Turks use it in cooking, and\n"
 "also carry it to Mecca, for the same purpose that frankincense is\n"
 "carried to St. Peter's in Rome. Some wine merchants drop a few grains\n"
 "into claret, to flavor it.  Who would think, then, that such fine\n"
 "ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in\n"
 "the inglorious bowels of a sick whale! Yet so it is. By some,\n"
 "ambergris is supposed to be the cause, and by others the effect, of\n"
 "the dyspepsia in the whale. How to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard\n"
 "to say, unless by administering three or four boat loads of\n"
 "Brandreth's pills, and then running out of harm's way, as laborers do\n"
 "in blasting rocks.  I have forgotten to say that there were found in\n"
 "this ambergris, certain hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb\n"
 "thought might be sailors' trousers buttons; but it afterwards turned\n"
 "out that they were nothing more than pieces of small squid bones\n"
 "embalmed in that manner.  Now that the incorruption of this most\n"
 "fragrant ambergris should be found in the heart of such decay; is this\n"
 "nothing? Bethink thee of that saying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about\n"
 "corruption and incorruption; how that we are sown in dishonor, but\n"
 "raised in glory. And likewise call to mind that saying of paracelsus\n"
 "about what it is that maketh the best musk. Also forget not the\n"
 "strange fact that of all things of ill- savor, Cologne-water, in its\n"
 "rudimental manufacturing stages, is the worst.  I should like to\n"
 "conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but cannot, owing to my\n"
 "anxiety to repel a charge often made\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " against whalemen, and which, in the estimation of some\n"
 "already biased minds, might be considered as indirectly substantiated\n"
 "by what has been said of the Frenchman's two whales. Elsewhere in this\n"
 "volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation\n"
 "of whaling is throughout a slatternly, untidy business. But there is\n"
 "another thing to rebut. They hint that all whales always smell\n"
 "bad. Now how did this odious stigma originate?  I opine, that it is\n"
 "plainly traceable to the first arrival of the Greenland whaling ships\n"
 "in London, more than two centuries ago. Because those whalemen did not\n"
 "then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea as the Southern ships\n"
 "have always done; but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits,\n"
 "thrust it through the bung holes of large casks, and carry it home in\n"
 "that manner; the shortness of the season in those Icy Seas, and the\n"
 "sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed, forbidding any\n"
 "other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking into the hold,\n"
 "and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a\n"
 "savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating\n"
 "an old city grave-yard, for the foundations of a Lying- in Hospital.\n"
 "I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be\n"
 "likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former\n"
 "times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which\n"
 "latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his\n"
 "great work on Smells, a textbook on that subject. As its name imports\n"
 "(smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order to\n"
 "afford a place for the blubber of the dutch whale fleet to be tried\n"
 "out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a\n"
 "collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works\n"
 "were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant\n"
 "savor. But all this is quite different from a South Sea Sperm Whaler;\n"
 "which in a voyage of four years perhaps, after completely filling her\n"
 "hold with oil, does not, perhaps, consume fifty days in the business\n"
 "of boiling out; and in the state that it is casked, the oil is nearly\n"
 "scentless. The truth is, that living or dead, if but decently treated,\n"
 "whales as a species are by no\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " means creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised,\n"
 "as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the\n"
 "company, by the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise\n"
 "than fragrant, when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health;\n"
 "taking abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true,\n"
 "seldom in the open air. I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale's\n"
 "flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk- scented lady\n"
 "rustles her dress in a warm parlor. What then shall I liken the Sperm\n"
 "Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude? Must it not be to\n"
 "that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with myrrh,\n"
 "which was led out of an Indian town to do honor to Alexander the\n"
 "Great?\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman,\n"
 "that a most significant event befell the most insignificant of the\n"
 "Pequod's crew; an event most lamentable; and which ended in providing\n"
 "the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and\n"
 "ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove\n"
 "her own.  Now, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the\n"
 "boats. Some few hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province\n"
 "it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale. As a\n"
 "general thing, these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men\n"
 "comprising the boats' crews. But if there happen to be an unduly\n"
 "slender, clumsy, or timorous wight in the ship, that wight is certain\n"
 "to be made a ship-keeper. It was so in the Pequod with the little\n"
 "negro Pippin by nick-name, Pip by abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have\n"
 "heard of him before; ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic\n"
 "midnight, so gloomy- jolly.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black\n"
 "pony and a white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar\n"
 "color, driven in one eccentric span. But while hapless Dough-Boy was\n"
 "by nature dull and torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over\n"
 "tender-hearted, was at bottom very bright, with that pleasant, genial,\n"
 "jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all\n"
 "holidays and festivities with finer, freer relish than any other\n"
 "race. For blacks, the year's calendar should show naught but three\n"
 "hundred and sixty-five Fourth of Julys and New Year's Days. Nor smile\n"
 "so, while I write that this little black was brilliant, for even\n"
 "blackness has its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous ebony, panelled in\n"
 "king's cabinets. But Pip loved life, and all life's peaceable\n"
 "securities; so that the panic-striking business in which he had\n"
 "somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred his\n"
 "brightness; though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus\n"
 "temporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly\n"
 "illumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to\n"
 "ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland County\n"
 "in Connecticut, he had once enlivened many a fiddler's frolic on the\n"
 "green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned the\n"
 "round horizon into one star-belled tambourine. So, though in the clear\n"
 "air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the pure-watered\n"
 "diamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning jeweller would\n"
 "show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he lays it against\n"
 "a gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the sun, but by some\n"
 "unnatural gases. Then come out those fiery effulgences, infernally\n"
 "superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once the divinest symbol of the\n"
 "crystal skies, looks like some crown- jewel stolen from the King of\n"
 "Hell. But let us to the story.  It came to pass, that in the ambergris\n"
 "affair Stubb's after-oarsman chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a\n"
 "time to become quite maimed; and, temporarily, Pip was put into his\n"
 "place.  The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much\n"
 "nervousness; but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with\n"
 "the whale; and therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though\n"
 "Stubb observing him, took care, afterwards,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost,\n"
 "for he might often find it needful.  Now upon the second lowering, the\n"
 "boat paddled upon the whale; and as the fish received the darted iron,\n"
 "it gave its customary rap, which happened, in this instance, to be\n"
 "right under poor Pip's seat. The involuntary consternation of the\n"
 "moment caused him to leap, paddle in hand, out of the boat; and in\n"
 "such a way, that part of the slack whale line coming against his\n"
 "chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as to become entangled in\n"
 "it, when at last plumping into the water. That instant the stricken\n"
 "whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly straightened; and\n"
 "presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat,\n"
 "remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken several turns\n"
 "around his chest and neck.  Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of\n"
 "the fire of the hunt. He hated Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the\n"
 "boat-knife from its sheath, he suspended its sharp edge over the line,\n"
 "and turning towards Stubb, exclaimed interrogatively, \"Cut?\"  Meantime\n"
 "Pip's blue, choked face plainly looked, Do, for God's sake! All passed\n"
 "in a flash. In less than half a minute, this entire thing happened.\n"
 "\"Damn him, cut!\" roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was\n"
 "saved.  So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was\n"
 "assailed by yells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting\n"
 "these irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain,\n"
 "business-like, but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially;\n"
 "and that done, unofficially gave him much wholesome advice. The\n"
 "substance was, Never jump from a boat, Pip, except - but all the rest\n"
 "was indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is. Now, in general, Stick\n"
 "to the boat, is your true motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes\n"
 "happen when Leap from the boat, is still better. Moreover, as if\n"
 "perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious\n"
 "advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in\n"
 "for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice, and concluded with\n"
 "a peremptory command, \"Stick to the boat, Pip, or by the Lord, I wont\n"
 "pick you up if you jump; mind that. We can't afford\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for\n"
 "thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in mind, and\n"
 "don't jump any more.\" Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that\n"
 "though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which\n"
 "propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.\n"
 "\n"
 "But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was\n"
 "under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but this\n"
 "time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started\n"
 "to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller's\n"
 "trunk. Alas! Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful,\n"
 "bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly\n"
 "stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like gold-beater's skin\n"
 "hammered out to the extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip's\n"
 "ebon head showed like a head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when\n"
 "he fell so rapidly astern. Stubb's inexorable back was turned upon\n"
 "him; and the whale was winged.  In three minutes, a whole mile of\n"
 "shoreless ocean was between Pip and Stubb. Out from the centre of the\n"
 "sea, poor Pip turned his crisp, curling, black head to the sun,\n"
 "another lonely castaway, though the loftiest and the brightest.  Now,\n"
 "in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practised\n"
 "swimmer as to ride in a spring- carriage ashore. But the awful\n"
 "lonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self in the\n"
 "middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark,\n"
 "how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea - mark how\n"
 "closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.  But had\n"
 "Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No; he did\n"
 "not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake, and\n"
 "he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip very\n"
 "quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations towards\n"
 "oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not always\n"
 "manifested by the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances\n"
 "not unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so\n"
 "called, is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to\n"
 "military navies and armies.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip,\n"
 "suddenly spying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave\n"
 "chase; and Stubb's boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew\n"
 "so intent upon his fish, that Pip's ringed horizon began to expand\n"
 "around him miserably. By the merest chance the ship itself at last\n"
 "rescued him; but from that hour the little negro went about the deck\n"
 "an idiot; such, at least, they said he was. The sea had jeeringly kept\n"
 "his finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned\n"
 "entirely, though. Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where\n"
 "strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before\n"
 "his passive eyes; and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded\n"
 "heaps; and among the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities, Pip\n"
 "saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the\n"
 "firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs. He saw God's foot upon\n"
 "the treadle of the loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates\n"
 "called him mad. So man's insanity is heaven's sense; and wandering\n"
 "from all mortal reason, man comes at last to that celestial thought,\n"
 "which, to reason, is absurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then\n"
 "uncompromised, indifferent as his God.  For the rest, blame not Stubb\n"
 "too hardly. The thing is common in that fishery; and in the sequel of\n"
 "the narrative, it will then be seen what like abandonment befell\n"
 "myself.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " That whale of Stubb's so dearly purchased, was duly brought\n"
 "to the Pequod's side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations\n"
 "previously detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling\n"
 "of the Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.  While some were occupied with this\n"
 "latter duty, others were employed in dragging away the larger tubs, so\n"
 "soon as filled with the sperm; and when the proper time arrived, this\n"
 "same\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " sperm was carefully manipulated ere going to the try-works,\n"
 "of which anon.  It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that\n"
 "when, with several others, I sat down before a large Constantine's\n"
 "bath of it, I found it strangely concreted into lumps, here and there\n"
 "rolling about in the liquid part. It was our business to squeeze these\n"
 "lumps back into fluid. A sweet and unctuous duty!  no wonder that in\n"
 "old times this sperm was such a favorite cosmetic. Such a clearer!\n"
 "such a sweetener! such a softener! such a delicious mollifier! After\n"
 "having my hands in it for only a few minutes, my fingers felt like\n"
 "eels, and began, as it were, to serpentine and spiralize.  As I sat\n"
 "there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter exertion\n"
 "at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under indolent\n"
 "sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands among those\n"
 "soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven almost within the\n"
 "hour; as they richly broke to my fingers, and discharged all their\n"
 "opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as I snuffed up that\n"
 "uncontaminated aroma, - literally and truly, like the smell of spring\n"
 "violets; I declare to you, that for the time I lived as in a musky\n"
 "meadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that inexpressible\n"
 "sperm, I washed my hands and my heart of it; I almost began to credit\n"
 "the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in\n"
 "allaying the heat of anger: while bathing in that bath, I felt\n"
 "divinely free from all ill-will, or petulence, or malice, of any sort\n"
 "whatsoever.  Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I\n"
 "squeezed that sperm till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed\n"
 "that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found\n"
 "myself unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers' hands in it, mistaking\n"
 "their hands for the gentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate,\n"
 "friendly, loving feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was\n"
 "continually squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes\n"
 "sentimentally; as much as to say, - Oh! my dear fellow beings, why\n"
 "should we longer cherish any social acerbities, or know the slightest\n"
 "ill-humor or envy!  Come; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us\n"
 "all squeeze ourselves\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " into each other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into\n"
 "the very milk and sperm of kindness.  Would that I could keep\n"
 "squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since by many prolonged,\n"
 "repeated experiences, I have perceived that in all cases man must\n"
 "eventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of attainable\n"
 "felicity; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy; but\n"
 "in the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the saddle, the fire-side,\n"
 "the country; now that I have perceived all this, I am ready to squeeze\n"
 "case eternally. In thoughts of the visions of the night, I saw long\n"
 "rows of angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of\n"
 "spermaceti.  Now, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of\n"
 "other things akin to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale\n"
 "for the try-works.  First comes white-horse, so called, which is\n"
 "obtained from the tapering part of the fish, and also from the thicker\n"
 "portions of his flukes. It is tough with congealed tendons - a wad of\n"
 "muscle - but still contains some oil. After being severed from the\n"
 "whale, the white-horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to\n"
 "the mincer. They look much like blocks of Berkshire marble.\n"
 "Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of\n"
 "the whale's flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber,\n"
 "and often participating to a considerable degree in its\n"
 "unctuousness. It is a most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to\n"
 "behold. As its name imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled\n"
 "tint, with a bestreaked snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of\n"
 "the deepest crimson and purple. It is plums of rubies, in pictures of\n"
 "citron. Spite of reason, it is hard to keep yourself from eating it.\n"
 "I confess, that once I stole behind the foremast to try it. It tasted\n"
 "something as I should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis\n"
 "le Gros might have tasted, supposing him to have been killed the first\n"
 "day after the venison season, and that particular venison season\n"
 "contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of\n"
 "Champagne.\n"

 " There is another substance, and a very singular one, which\n"
 "turns up in the course of this business, but which I feel it to be\n"
 "very puzzling adequately to describe. It is called slobgollion; an\n"
 "appellation original with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of\n"
 "the substance. It is an ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most\n"
 "frequently found in the tubs of sperm, after a prolonged squeezing,\n"
 "and subsequent decanting. I hold it to be the wondrously thin,\n"
 "ruptured membranes of the case, coalescing.  Gurry, so called, is a\n"
 "term properly belonging to right whalemen, but sometimes incidentally\n"
 "used by the sperm fishermen. It designates the dark, glutinous\n"
 "substance which is scraped off the back of the Greenland or right\n"
 "whale, and much of which covers the decks of those inferior souls who\n"
 "hunt that ignoble Leviathan.  Nippers. Strictly this word is not\n"
 "indigenous to the whale's vocabulary. But as applied by whalemen, it\n"
 "becomes so. A whaleman's nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous\n"
 "stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathan's tail: it averages an\n"
 "inch in thickness, and for the rest, is about the size of the iron\n"
 "part of a hoe. Edgewise moved along the oily deck, it operates like a\n"
 "leathern squilgee; and by nameless blandishments, as of magic, allures\n"
 "along with it all impurities.  But to learn all about these recondite\n"
 "matters, your best way is at once to descend into the blubber-room,\n"
 "and have a long talk with its inmates. This place has previously been\n"
 "mentioned as the receptacle for the blanket-pieces, when stript and\n"
 "hoisted from the whale. When the proper time arrives for cutting up\n"
 "its contents, this apartment is a scene of terror to all tyros,\n"
 "especially by night. On one side, lit by a dull lantern, a space has\n"
 "been left clear for the workmen. They generally go in pairs, - a\n"
 "pike-and-gaff-man and a spade-man. The whaling-pike is similar to a\n"
 "frigate's boarding-weapon of the same name. The gaff is something like\n"
 "a boat-hook. With his gaff, the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of\n"
 "blubber, and strives to hold it from slipping, as the ship pitches and\n"
 "lurches about. Meanwhile, the spade-man stands on the sheet itself,\n"
 "perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse-pieces. This spade\n"
 "is sharp as hone can make it; the spademan's feet are shoeless; the\n"
 "thing\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him,\n"
 "like a sledge. If he cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his\n"
 "assistants', would you be very much astonished? Toes are scarce among\n"
 "veteran blubber-room men.  Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a\n"
 "certain juncture of this post-mortemizing of the whale; and had you\n"
 "strolled forward nigh the windlass, pretty sure am I that you would\n"
 "have scanned with no small curiosity a very strange, enigmatical\n"
 "object, which you would have seen there, lying along lengthwise in the\n"
 "lee scuppers. Not the wondrous cistern in the whale's huge head; not\n"
 "the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw; not the miracle of his\n"
 "symmetrical tail; none of these would so surprise you, as half a\n"
 "glimpse of that unaccountable cone, - longer than a Kentuckian is\n"
 "tall, nigh a foot in diameter at the base, and jet-black as Yojo, the\n"
 "ebony idol of Queequeg. And an idol, indeed, it is; or, rather, in old\n"
 "times, its likeness was. Such an idol as that found in the secret\n"
 "groves of Queen Maachah in Judea; and for worshipping which, king Asa,\n"
 "her son, did depose her, and destroyed the idol, and burnt it for an\n"
 "abomination at the brook Kedron, as darkly set forth in the 15th\n"
 "chapter of the first book of Kings.  Look at the sailor, called the\n"
 "mincer, who now comes along, and assisted by two allies, heavily backs\n"
 "the grandissimus, as the mariners call it, and with bowed shoulders,\n"
 "staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade\n"
 "from the field. extending it upon the forecastle deck, he now proceeds\n"
 "cylindrically to remove its dark pelt, as an African hunter the pelt\n"
 "of a boa.  This done he turns the pelt inside out, like a pantaloon\n"
 "leg; gives it a good stretching, so as almost to double its diameter;\n"
 "and at last hangs it, well spread, in the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " rigging, to dry. Ere long, it is taken down; when removing\n"
 "some three feet of it, towards the pointed extremity, and then cutting\n"
 "two slits for arm-holes at the other end, he lengthwise slips himself\n"
 "bodily into it. The mincer now stands before you invested in the full\n"
 "canonicals of his calling. Immemorial to all his order, this\n"
 "investiture alone will adequately protect him, while employed in the\n"
 "peculiar functions of his office.  That office consists in mincing the\n"
 "horse-pieces of blubber for the pots; an operation which is conducted\n"
 "at a curious wooden horse, planted endwise against the bulwarks, and\n"
 "with a capacious tub beneath it, into which the minced pieces drop,\n"
 "fast as the sheets from a rapt orator's desk. Arrayed in decent black;\n"
 "occupying a conspicuous pulpit; intent on bible leaves; what a\n"
 "candidate for an archbishoprick, what a lad for a Pope were this\n"
 "mincer! Bible leaves! Bible leaves! This is the invariable cry from\n"
 "the mates to the mincer. It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his\n"
 "work into as thin slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the\n"
 "business of boiling out the oil is much accelerated, and its quantity\n"
 "considerably increased, besides perhaps improving it in quality.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Besides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly\n"
 "distinguished by her try-works. She presents the curious anomaly of\n"
 "the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the\n"
 "completed ship. it is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were\n"
 "transported to her planks.  The try-works are planted between the\n"
 "foremast and main-mast, the most roomy part of the deck. The timbers\n"
 "beneath are of a peculiar strength, fitted to sustain the weight of an\n"
 "almost solid mass of brick and mortar, some ten feet by eight square,\n"
 "and five in height. The foundation does not penetrate the deck, but\n"
 "the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides, and screwing\n"
 "it down to the timbers. On the flanks it is cased with wood, and at\n"
 "top completely covered by a large, sloping, battened\n"
 "hatchway. Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots, two in\n"
 "number, and each of several barrels' capacity. When not in use, they\n"
 "are kept remarkably clean. Sometimes they are polished with soapstone\n"
 "and sand, till they shine within like silver punch-bowls. During the\n"
 "night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil\n"
 "themselves away there for a nap. While employed in polishing them -\n"
 "one man in each pot, side by side - many confidential communications\n"
 "are carried on, over the iron lips. It is a place also for profound\n"
 "mathematical meditation. It was in the left hand try-pot of the\n"
 "Pequod, with the soapstone diligently circling round me, that I was\n"
 "first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in geometry all\n"
 "bodies gliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example, will\n"
 "descend from any point in precisely the same time.  Removing the\n"
 "fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare masonry of that\n"
 "side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of the furnaces,\n"
 "directly underneath the pots. These mouths are fitted with heavy doors\n"
 "of iron.  The intense heat of the fire is prevented from communicating\n"
 "itself to the deck, by means of a shallow reservoir extending under\n"
 "the entire inclosed surface of the works. By a tunnel inserted at the\n"
 "rear, this reservoir is kept replenished with water as fast as it\n"
 "evaporates. There are no external chimneys; they open direct from the\n"
 "rear wall. And here let us go back for a moment.  It was about nine\n"
 "o'clock at night that the Pequod's try- works were first started on\n"
 "this present voyage. It belonged to Stubb to oversee the business.\n"
 "\"All ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the\n"
 "works.\"  This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting\n"
 "his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage. Here be it said\n"
 "that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be fed\n"
 "for a time with wood. After that no wood is used, except as a means of\n"
 "quick ignition to the staple fuel. In a word, after being tried out,\n"
 "the crisp, shrivelled\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still contains\n"
 "considerable of its unctuous properties. These fritters feed the\n"
 "flames. Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming\n"
 "misanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns\n"
 "by his own body. Would that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke\n"
 "is horrible to inhale, and inhale it you must, and not only that, but\n"
 "you must live in it for the time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo\n"
 "odor about it, such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres. It\n"
 "smells like the left wing of the day of judgment; it is an argument\n"
 "for the pit.  By midnight the works were in full operation. We were\n"
 "clear from the carcase; sail had been made; the wind was freshening;\n"
 "the wild ocean darkness was intense. But that darkness was licked up\n"
 "by the fierce flames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty\n"
 "flues, and illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the\n"
 "famed Greek fire. The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly\n"
 "commissioned to some vengeful deed. So the pitch and sulphur-\n"
 "freighted brigs of the bold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their\n"
 "midnight harbors, with broad sheets of flame for sails, bore down upon\n"
 "the turkish frigates, and folded them in conflagrations.  The hatch,\n"
 "removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide hearth in front\n"
 "of them. Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of the pagan\n"
 "harpooneers, always the whale-ship's stokers. With huge pronged poles\n"
 "they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots, or\n"
 "stirred up the fires beneath, till the snaky flames darted, curling,\n"
 "out of the doors to catch them by the feet. The smoke rolled away in\n"
 "sullen heaps. To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the\n"
 "boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to leap into their\n"
 "faces. Opposite the mouth of the works, on the further side of the\n"
 "wide wooden hearth, was the windlass. This served for a sea-sofa. Here\n"
 "lounged the watch, when not otherwise employed, looking into the red\n"
 "heat of the fire, till their eyes felt scorched in their heads. Their\n"
 "tawny features, now all begrimed with smoke and sweat, their matted\n"
 "beards, and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth, all\n"
 "these were strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the\n"
 "works. As they\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " narrated to each other their unholy adventures, their tales\n"
 "of terror told in words of mirth; as their uncivilized laughter forked\n"
 "upwards out of them, like the flames from the furnace; as to and fro,\n"
 "in their front, the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge\n"
 "pronged forks and dippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped,\n"
 "and the ship groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell\n"
 "further and further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and\n"
 "scornfully champed the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat\n"
 "round her on all sides; then the rushing Pequod, freighted with\n"
 "savages, and laden with fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into\n"
 "that blackness of darkness, seemed the material counterpart of her\n"
 "monomaniac commander's soul.  So seemed it to me, as I stood at her\n"
 "helm, and for long hours silently guided the way of this fire- ship on\n"
 "the sea. Wrapped, for that interval, in darkness myself, I but the\n"
 "better saw the redness, the madness, the ghastliness of others. The\n"
 "continual sight of the fiend shapes before me, capering half in smoke\n"
 "and half in fire, these at last begat kindred visions in my soul, so\n"
 "soon as I began to yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever\n"
 "would come over me at a midnight helm.  But that night, in particular,\n"
 "a strange (and ever since inexplicable) thing occurred to me. Starting\n"
 "from a brief standing sleep, I was horribly conscious of something\n"
 "fatally wrong. The jaw-bone tiller smote my side, which leaned against\n"
 "it; in my ears was the low hum of sails, just beginning to shake in\n"
 "the wind; I thought my eyes were open; I was half conscious of putting\n"
 "my fingers to the lids and mechanically stretching them still further\n"
 "apart. But, spite of all this, I could see no compass before me to\n"
 "steer by; though it seemed but a minute since I had been watching the\n"
 "card, by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it. Nothing seemed\n"
 "before me but a jet gloom, now and then made ghastly by flashes of\n"
 "redness. Uppermost was the impression, that whatever swift, rushing\n"
 "thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing\n"
 "from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, came\n"
 "over me. Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with the crazy\n"
 "conceit that the tiller was, somehow,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " in some enchanted way, inverted. My God! what is the matter\n"
 "with me? thought I.  Lo! in my brief sleep I had turned myself about,\n"
 "and was fronting the ship's stern, with my back to her prow and the\n"
 "compass. In an instant I faced back, just in time to prevent the\n"
 "vessel from flying up into the wind, and very probably capsizing\n"
 "her. How glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural\n"
 "hallucination of the night, and the fatal contingency of being brought\n"
 "by the lee!  Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man! Never\n"
 "dream with thy hand on the helm! Turn not thy back to the compass;\n"
 "accept the first hint of the hitching tiller; believe not the\n"
 "artificial fire, when its redness makes all things look\n"
 "ghastly. To-morrow, in the natural sun, the skies will be bright;\n"
 "those who glared like devils in the forking flames, the morn will show\n"
 "in far other, at least gentler, relief; the glorious, golden, glad\n"
 "sun, the only true lamp - all others but liars!  Nevertheless the sun\n"
 "hides not Virginia's Dismal Swamp, nor Rome's accursed Campagna, nor\n"
 "wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of deserts and of griefs\n"
 "beneath the moon. The sun hides not the ocean, which is the dark side\n"
 "of this earth, and which is two thirds of this earth. So, therefore,\n"
 "that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him, that mortal\n"
 "man cannot be true - not true, or undeveloped. With books the\n"
 "same. The truest of all men was the Man of Sorrows, and the truest of\n"
 "all books is Solomon's, and Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of\n"
 "woe. \"All is vanity\". ALL. This wilful world hath not got hold of\n"
 "unchristian Solomon's wisdom yet. But he who dodges hospitals and\n"
 "jails, and walks fast crossing grave- yards, and would rather talk of\n"
 "operas than hell; calls Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils\n"
 "all of sick men; and throughout a care-free lifetime swears by\n"
 "Rabelais as passing wise, and therefore jolly; - not that man is\n"
 "fitted to sit down on tomb-stones, and break the green damp mould with\n"
 "unfathomably wondrous Solomon.  But even Solomon, he says, \"the man\n"
 "that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain\"\n"
 "(i. e. even while living) \"in the congregation of the dead\". Give not\n"
 "thyself up, then, to fire, lest it invert thee, deaden thee; as for\n"
 "the time it did me.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " There is a wisdom that is woe; but there is a woe that is\n"
 "madness. And there is a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike\n"
 "dive down into the blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and\n"
 "become invisible in the sunny spaces. And even if he for ever flies\n"
 "within the gorge, that gorge is in the mountains; so that even in his\n"
 "lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon\n"
 "the plain, even though they soar.  Had you descended from the Pequod's\n"
 "try-works to the Pequod's forecastle, where the off duty watch were\n"
 "sleeping, for one single moment you would have almost thought you were\n"
 "standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized kings and\n"
 "counsellors. There they lay in their triangular oaken vaults, each\n"
 "mariner a chiselled muteness; a score of lamps flashing upon his\n"
 "hooded eyes.  In merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than\n"
 "the milk of queens. To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and\n"
 "stumble in darkness to his pallet, this is his usual lot. But the\n"
 "whaleman, as he seeks the food of light, so he lives in light. He\n"
 "makes his berth an Aladdin's lamp, and lays him down in it; so that in\n"
 "the pitchiest night the ship's black hull still houses an\n"
 "illumination.  See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his\n"
 "handful of lamps - often but old bottles and vials, though - to the\n"
 "copper cooler at the try-works, and replenishes them there, as mugs of\n"
 "ale at a vat. He burns, too, the purest of oil, in its unmanufactured,\n"
 "and, therefore, unvitiated state; a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or\n"
 "astral contrivances ashore. It is sweet as early grass butter in\n"
 "April. He goes and hunts for his oil, so as to be sure of its\n"
 "freshness and genuineness, even as the traveller on the prairie hunts\n"
 "up his own supper of game.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Already has it been related how the great Leviathan is afar\n"
 "off descried from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery\n"
 "moors, and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then\n"
 "towed alongside and beheaded; and how (on the principle which entitled\n"
 "the headsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed)\n"
 "his great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner; how,\n"
 "in due time, he is condemned to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach,\n"
 "and Abednego, his spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through the\n"
 "fire; - but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part\n"
 "of the description by rehearsing - singing, if I may - the romantic\n"
 "proceeding of decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them\n"
 "down into the hold, where once again leviathan returns to his native\n"
 "profundities, sliding along beneath the surface as before; but, alas!\n"
 "never more to rise and blow.  While still warm, the oil, like hot\n"
 "punch, is received into the six-barrel casks; and while, perhaps, the\n"
 "ship is pitching and rolling this way and that in the midnight sea,\n"
 "the enormous casks are slewed round and headed over, end for end, and\n"
 "sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery deck, like so many land\n"
 "slides, till at last man-handled and stayed in their course; and all\n"
 "round the hoops, rap, rap, go as many hammers as can play upon them,\n"
 "for now, ex officio, every sailor is a cooper.  At length, when the\n"
 "last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the great hatchways are\n"
 "unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open, and down go the\n"
 "casks to their final rest in the sea. This done, the hatches are\n"
 "replaced, and hermetically closed, like a closet walled up.  In the\n"
 "sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable incidents in\n"
 "all the business of whaling. One day the planks stream with freshets\n"
 "of blood and oil; on the sacred\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " quarter-deck enormous masses of the whale's head are\n"
 "profanely piled; great rusty casks lie about, as in a brewery yard;\n"
 "the smoke from the try-works has besooted all the bulwarks; the\n"
 "mariners go about suffused with unctuousness; the entire ship seems\n"
 "great Leviathan himself; while on all hands the din is deafening.  But\n"
 "a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this\n"
 "self-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works,\n"
 "you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a\n"
 "most scrupulously neat commander. The unmanufactured sperm oil\n"
 "possesses a singularly cleansing virtue. This is the reason why the\n"
 "decks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of\n"
 "oil. Besides, from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale, a\n"
 "potent ley is readily made; and whenever any adhesiveness from the\n"
 "back of the whale remains clinging to the side, that ley quickly\n"
 "exterminates it.  Hands go diligently along the bulwarks, and with\n"
 "buckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness. The\n"
 "soot is brushed from the lower rigging.  All the numerous implements\n"
 "which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put\n"
 "away. The great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try-works,\n"
 "completely hiding the pots; every cask is out of sight; all tackles\n"
 "are coiled in unseen nooks; and when by the combined and simultaneous\n"
 "industry of almost the entire ship's company, the whole of this\n"
 "conscientious duty is at last concluded, then the crew themselves\n"
 "proceed to their own ablutions; shift themselves from top to toe; and\n"
 "finally issue to the immaculate deck, fresh and all aglow, as\n"
 "bridegrooms new-leaped from out the daintiest Holland.  Now, with\n"
 "elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and humorously\n"
 "discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics; propose to\n"
 "mat the deck; think of having hangings to the top; object not to\n"
 "taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle. To hint to\n"
 "such musked mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber, were little short\n"
 "of audacity. They know not the thing you distantly allude to. Away,\n"
 "and bring us napkins!  But mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads,\n"
 "stand three\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " men intent on spying out more whales, which, if caught,\n"
 "infallibly will again soil the old oaken furniture, and drop at least\n"
 "one small grease-spot somewhere.  Yes; and many is the time, when,\n"
 "after the severest uninterrupted labors, which know no night;\n"
 "continuing straight through for ninety-six hours; when from the boat,\n"
 "where they have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the Line,\n"
 "- they only step to the deck to carry vast chains, and heave the heavy\n"
 "windlass, and cut and slash, yea, and in their very sweatings to be\n"
 "smoked and burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun and\n"
 "the equatorial try-works; when, on the heel of all this, they have\n"
 "finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship, and make a spotless\n"
 "dairy room of it; many is the time the poor fellows, just buttoning\n"
 "the necks of their clean frocks, are startled by the cry of \"There she\n"
 "blows!\" and away they fly to fight another whale, and go through the\n"
 "whole weary thing again. Oh! my friends, but this is man-killing! Yet\n"
 "this is life. For hardly have we mortals by long toilings extracted\n"
 "from the world's vast bulk its small but valuable sperm; and then,\n"
 "with weary patience, cleansed ourselves from its defilements, and\n"
 "learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul; hardly is this\n"
 "done, when - There she blows! - the ghost is spouted up, and away we\n"
 "sail to fight some other world, and go through young life's old\n"
 "routine again.  Oh! the metempsychosis! Oh! Pythagoras, that in bright\n"
 "Greece, two thousand years ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; I\n"
 "sailed with thee along the Peruvian coast last voyage - and, foolish\n"
 "as I am, taught thee, a green simple boy, how to splice a rope!\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his\n"
 "quarter-deck, taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " and mainmast; but in the multiplicity of other things\n"
 "requiring narration it has not been added how that sometimes in these\n"
 "walks, when most plunged in his mood, he was wont to pause in turn at\n"
 "each spot, and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object\n"
 "before him. When he halted before the binnacle, with his glance\n"
 "fastened on the pointed needle in the compass, that glance shot like a\n"
 "javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose; and when resuming\n"
 "his walk he again paused before the mainmast, then, as the same\n"
 "riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there, he still\n"
 "wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed with a certain\n"
 "wild longing, if not hopefulness.  But one morning, turning to pass\n"
 "the doubloon, he seemed to be newly attracted by the strange figures\n"
 "and inscriptions stamped on it, as though now for the first time\n"
 "beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac way whatever\n"
 "significance might lurk in them. And some certain significance lurks\n"
 "in all things, else all things are little worth, and the round world\n"
 "itself but an empty cipher, except to sell by the cartload, as they do\n"
 "hills about Boston, to fill up some morass in the Milky Way.  Now this\n"
 "doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of the heart\n"
 "of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands, the\n"
 "head-waters of many a Pactolus flows. And though now nailed amidst all\n"
 "the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes, yet,\n"
 "untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its\n"
 "Quito glow. Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour\n"
 "passed by ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded\n"
 "with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach,\n"
 "nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it\n"
 "last. For it was set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and\n"
 "however wanton in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered\n"
 "it as the White Whale's talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the\n"
 "weary watch by night, wondering whose it was to be at last, and\n"
 "whether he would ever live to spend it.  Now those noble golden coins\n"
 "of South America are as\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " medals of the sun and tropic token-pieces. Here palms,\n"
 "alpacas, and volcanoes; sun's disks and stars; ecliptics,\n"
 "horns-of-plenty, and rich banners waving, are in luxuriant profusion\n"
 "stamped; so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added\n"
 "preciousness and enhancing glories, by passing through those fancy\n"
 "mints, so Spanishly poetic.  It so chanced that the doubloon of the\n"
 "Pequod was a most wealthy example of these things. On its round border\n"
 "it bore the letters, REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR: QUITO. So this bright coin\n"
 "came from a country planted in the middle of the world, and beneath\n"
 "the great equator, and named after it; and it had been cast midway up\n"
 "the Andes, in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn. Zoned by those\n"
 "letters you saw the likeness of three Andes' summits; from one a\n"
 "flame; a tower on another; on the third a crowing cock; while arching\n"
 "over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac, the signs all marked\n"
 "with their usual cabalistics, and the keystone sun entering the\n"
 "equinoctial point at Libra.  Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not\n"
 "unobserved by others, was now pausing.  \"There's something ever\n"
 "egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and all other grand and lofty\n"
 "things; look here, - three peaks as proud as Lucifer. The firm tower,\n"
 "that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the courageous, the\n"
 "undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all are Ahab; and\n"
 "this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe, which, like a\n"
 "magician's glass, to each and every man in turn but mirrors back his\n"
 "own mysterious self. Great pains, small gains for those who ask the\n"
 "world to solve them; it cannot solve itself.  Methinks now this coined\n"
 "sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the sign of storms,\n"
 "the equinox! and but six months before he wheeled out of a former\n"
 "equinox at Aries! From storm to storm! So be it, then. Born in throes,\n"
 "'t is fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs! So be it,\n"
 "then! Here's stout stuff for woe to work on. So be it, then.\"  \"No\n"
 "fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil's claws must have\n"
 "left their mouldings there since yesterday,\" murmured Starbuck to\n"
 "himself, leaning against the bulwarks. \"The old\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " man seems to read Belshazzar's awful writing. I have never\n"
 "marked the coin inspectingly. He goes below; let me read. A dark\n"
 "valley between three mighty, heaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem\n"
 "the Trinity, in some faint earthly symbol. So in this vale of Death,\n"
 "God girds us round; and over all our gloom, the sun of Righteousness\n"
 "still shines a beacon and a hope. If we bend down our eyes, the dark\n"
 "vale shows her mouldy soil; but if we lift them, the bright sun meets\n"
 "our glance half way, to cheer. Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture;\n"
 "and if, at midnight, we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him,\n"
 "we gaze for him in vain! This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but\n"
 "still sadly to me. I will quit it, lest Truth shake me falsely.\"\n"
 "\"There now's the old Mogul,\" soliloquized Stubb by the try-works,\n"
 "\"he's been twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same, and\n"
 "both with faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine\n"
 "fathoms long. And all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I\n"
 "have it now on Negro Hill or in Corlaer's Hook, I'd not look at it\n"
 "very long ere spending it. Humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion, I\n"
 "regard this as queer. I have seen doubloons before now in my\n"
 "voyagings; your doubloons of old Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your\n"
 "doubloons of Chili, your doubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons of\n"
 "Popayan; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles, and joes, and half\n"
 "joes, and quarter joes. what then should there be in this doubloon of\n"
 "the Equator that is so killing wonderful? By Golconda! let me read it\n"
 "once. Halloa! here's signs and wonders truly! That, now, is what old\n"
 "Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac, and what my almanack below\n"
 "calls ditto. I'll get the almanack and as I have heard devils can be\n"
 "raised with Daboll's arithmetic, I'll try my hand at raising a meaning\n"
 "out of these queer curvicues here with the Massachusetts\n"
 "calendar. Here's the book.  Let's see now. Signs and wonders; and the\n"
 "sun, he's always among 'em. Hem, hem, hem; here they are - here they\n"
 "go - all alive: - Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the Bull and Jimimi!\n"
 "here's Gemini himself, or the Twins. Well; the sun he wheels among\n"
 "'em. Aye, here on the coin he's just crossing the threshold between\n"
 "two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring. Book! you lie there; the\n"
 "fact is, you books must know your\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " places. You'll do to give us the bare words and facts, but we\n"
 "come in to supply the thoughts. That's my small experience, so far as\n"
 "the Massachusetts calendar, and Bowditch's navigator, and Daboll's\n"
 "arithmetic go. Signs and wonders, eh?  Pity if there is nothing\n"
 "wonderful in signs, and significant in wonders! There's a clue\n"
 "somewhere; wait a bit; hist - hark! By Jove, I have it! Look you,\n"
 "Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter;\n"
 "and now I'll read it off, straight out of the book. Come, Almanack! To\n"
 "begin: there's Aries, or the Ram - lecherous dog, he begets us; then,\n"
 "Taurus, or the Bull - he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini, or the\n"
 "Twins - that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo!\n"
 "comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from Virtue,\n"
 "Leo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path - he gives a few fierce bites\n"
 "and surly dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin!\n"
 "that's our first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye, when\n"
 "pop comes Libra, or the Scales - happiness weighed and found wanting;\n"
 "and while we are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as\n"
 "Scorpio, or the Scorpion, stings us in rear; we are curing the wound,\n"
 "when whang come the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is\n"
 "amusing himself. As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside; here's the\n"
 "battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing,\n"
 "and headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Water- bearer, pours\n"
 "out his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the\n"
 "Fishes, we sleep. There's a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the\n"
 "sun goes through it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and\n"
 "hearty. Jollily he, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and\n"
 "so, alow here, does jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly's the word for aye! Adieu,\n"
 "Doubloon! But stop; here comes little King-Post; dodge round the\n"

 "before it; he'll out with something presently. So, so; he's\n"
 "beginning.\"  \"I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and\n"
 "whoever raises a certain whale, this round thing belongs to him. So,\n"
 "what's all this staring been about? It is worth sixteen dollars,\n"
 "that's true; and at two cents the cigar, that's nine hundred and\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " sixty cigars. I wont smoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like\n"
 "cigars, and here's nine hundred and sixty of them; so here goes Flask\n"

 "be really wise it has a foolish look to it; yet, if it be really\n"
 "foolish, then has it a sort of wiseish look to it. But, avast; here\n"
 "comes our old Manxman - the old hearse-driver, he must have been, that\n"
 "is, before he took to the sea. He luffs up before the doubloon;\n"
 "halloa, and goes round on the other side of the mast; why, there's a\n"
 "horse-shoe nailed on that side; and now he's back again; what does\n"
 "that mean? Hark! he's muttering - voice like an old worn-out\n"
 "coffee-mill. Prick ears, and listen!\"  \"If the White Whale be raised,\n"
 "it must be in a month and a day, when the sun stands in some one of\n"

 "what sign will the sun then be? The horse-shoe sign; for there it is,\n"
 "right opposite the gold. And what's the horse-shoe sign? The lion is\n"

 "comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone; thinks the sun is in the\n"
 "thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels, I suppose, as the old women\n"
 "talk Surgeon's Astronomy in the back country. And by Jove, he's found\n"
 "something there in the vicinity of his thigh - I guess it's\n"
 "Sagittarius, or the Archer. No: he don't know what to make of the\n"
 "doubloon; he takes it for an old button off some king's trowsers. But,\n"
 "aside again! here comes that ghost-devil, Fedallah; tail coiled out of\n"
 "sight as usual, oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual. What does he\n"
 "say, with that look of his? Ah, only makes a sign to the sign and bows\n"
 "himself; there is a sun on the coin - fire worshipper, depend upon\n"
 "it. Ho! more and more.  This way comes Pip - poor boy! would he had\n"
 "died, or I; he's half horrible to me. He too has been watching all of\n"
 "these interpreters - myself included - and look now, he comes to read,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " with that unearthly idiot face. stand away again and hear\n"
 "him. Hark!\"  \"I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they\n"
 "look.\"  \"Upon my soul, he's been studying Murray's Grammar! Improving\n"

 "crow? And where's the scare-crow? There he stands; two bones stuck\n"
 "into a pair of old trowsers, and two more poked into the sleeves of an\n"
 "old jacket.\"  \"Wonder if he means me? - complimentary! - poor lad! - I\n"
 "could go hang myself.  Any way, for the present, I'll quit Pip's\n"
 "vicinity. I can stand the rest, for they have plain wits; but he's too\n"
 "crazy-witty for my sanity. So, so, I leave him muttering.\"  \"Here's\n"
 "the ship's navel, this doubloon here, and they are all on fire to\n"
 "unscrew it. But, unscrew your navel, and what's the consequence? Then\n"
 "again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for when aught's nailed to\n"
 "the mast it's a sign that things grow desperate. Ha, ha! old Ahab! the\n"
 "White Whale; he'll nail ye! This is a pine tree. My father, in old\n"
 "Tolland county, cut down a pine tree once, and found a silver ring\n"
 "grown over in it; some old darkey's wedding ring.  How did it get\n"
 "there? And so they'll say in the resurrection, when they come to zfish\n"
 "up this old mast, and find a doubloon lodged in it, with bedded\n"
 "oysters for the shaggy bark. Oh, the gold! the precious, precious\n"
 "gold! - the green miser 'll hoard ye soon! Hish! hish! God goes 'mong\n"
 "the worlds blackberrying.  Cook! ho, cook! and cook us! Jenny! hey,\n"
 "hey, hey, hey, hey, Jenny, Jenny! and get your hoe- cake done!\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Ship, ahoy! Hast seen the White Whale?  So cried Ahab, once\n"
 "more hailing a ship showing English colors, bearing down under the\n"
 "stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was standing in his hoisted\n"
 "quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain,\n"
 "who was carelessly reclining in his own boat's bow. He was a\n"
 "darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of sixty or\n"
 "thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round him in\n"
 "festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm of this jacket\n"
 "streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a huzzar's surcoat.\n"
 "\"Hast seen the White Whale?\"  \"See you this?\" and withdrawing it from\n"
 "the fold that had hidden it, he held up a white arm of sperm whale\n"
 "bone, terminating in a wooden head like a mallet.  \"Man my boat!\"\n"
 "cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars near him - \"Stand\n"
 "by to lower!\"  In less than a minute, without quitting his little\n"
 "craft, he and his crew were dropped to the water, and were soon\n"
 "alongside of the stranger. But here a curious difficulty presented\n"
 "itself. In the excitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since\n"
 "the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel\n"
 "at sea but his own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very\n"
 "handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not\n"
 "to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment's\n"
 "warning. Now, it is no very easy matter for anybody - except those who\n"
 "are almost hourly used to it, like whalemen - to clamber up a ship's\n"
 "side from a boat on the open sea; for the great swells now lift the\n"
 "boat high up towards\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the bulwarks, and then instantaneously drop it half way down\n"
 "to the kelson. so, deprived of one leg, and the strange ship of course\n"
 "being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now found\n"
 "himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly eyeing\n"
 "the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain.  It has\n"
 "before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward circumstance\n"
 "that befel him, and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap,\n"
 "almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And in the present\n"
 "instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the two officers of\n"
 "the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the perpendicular ladder\n"
 "of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a pair of\n"
 "tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem to\n"
 "bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to\n"
 "use their sea bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute,\n"
 "because the strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood,\n"
 "cried out, \"I see, I see! - avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing\n"
 "over the cutting-tackle.\"  As good luck would have it, they had had a\n"
 "whale alongside a day or two previous, and the great tackles were\n"
 "still aloft, and the massive curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry,\n"
 "was still attached to the end. This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who\n"
 "at once comprehending it all, slid his solitary thigh into the curve\n"
 "of the hook (it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor, or the\n"
 "crotch of an apple tree), and then giving the word, held himself fast,\n"
 "and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight, by pulling\n"
 "hand-over-hand upon one of the running parts of the tackle. Soon he\n"
 "was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks, and gently landed upon\n"
 "the capstan head. With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome,\n"
 "the other captain advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg, and\n"
 "crossing the ivory arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in his\n"
 "walrus way, \"Aye, aye, hearty! let us shake bones together! - an arm\n"
 "and a leg! - an arm that never can shrink, d'ye see; and a leg that\n"
 "never can run. Where did'st thou see the White Whale? - how long ago?\"\n"
 "\"The White Whale\", said the Englishman, pointing his ivory\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " arm towards the East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as\n"
 "if it had been a telescope; \"There I saw him, on the Line, last\n"
 "season.\"  \"And he took that arm off, did he?\" asked Ahab, now sliding\n"
 "down from the capstan, and resting on the Englishman's shoulder, as he\n"
 "did so.  \"Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?\"\n"
 "\"Spin me the yarn,\" said Ahab; \"how was it?\"  \"It was the first time\n"
 "in my life that I ever cruised on the Line\", began the Englishman. \"I\n"
 "was ignorant of the White Whale at that time. Well, one day we lowered\n"
 "for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat fastened to one of them;\n"
 "a regular circus horse he was, too, that went milling and milling\n"
 "round so, that my boat's crew could only trim dish, by sitting all\n"
 "their sterns on the outer gunwale. Presently up breaches from the\n"
 "bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky-white head and\n"
 "hump, all crows' feet and wrinkles.\"  \"It was he, it was he!\" cried\n"
 "Ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended breath.  \"And harpoons\n"
 "sticking in near his starboard fin.\"  \"Aye, aye - they were mine - my\n"
 "irons,\" cried Ahab, exultingly - \"but on!\"  \"Give me a chance, then,\"\n"
 "said the Englishman, good-humoredly. \"Well, this old\n"
 "great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs all afoam into\n"
 "the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line.\"  \"Aye, I\n"
 "see! - wanted to part it; free the fast-fish - an old trick - I know\n"
 "him.\"  \"How it was exactly,\" continued the one-armed commander, \"I do\n"
 "not know; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught\n"
 "there somehow; but we didn't know it then; so that when we afterwards\n"
 "pulled on the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of\n"
 "the other whale's that went off to windward, all fluking. Seeing how\n"
 "matters stood, and what a noble great whale it was - the noblest and\n"
 "biggest I ever saw, Sir, in my life - I resolved to capture him, spite\n"
 "of the boiling rage he seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard\n"
 "line would get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I\n"
 "have\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " a devil of a boat's crew for a pull on a whale-line); seeing\n"
 "all this, I say, I jumped into my first mate's boat - Mr. Mounttop's\n"
 "here (by the way, Captain - Mounttop; Mounttop - the captain); - as I\n"
 "was saying, I jumped into Mounttop's boat, which, d'ye see, was\n"
 "gunwale and gunwale with mine, then; and snatching the first harpoon,\n"
 "let this old great-grandfather have it. But, Lord, look you, Sir -\n"
 "hearts and souls alive, man - the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind\n"
 "as a bat - both eyes out - all befogged and bedeadened with black foam\n"
 "- the whale's tail looming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the\n"
 "air, like a marble steeple. No use sterning all, then; but as I was\n"
 "groping at midday, with a blinding sun, all crown-jewels; as I was\n"
 "groping, I say, after the second iron, to toss it overboard - down\n"
 "comes the tail like a Lima tower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each\n"
 "half in splinters; and, flukes first, the white hump backed through\n"
 "the wreck, as though it was all chips. We all struck out. To escape\n"
 "his terrible flailings, I seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in\n"
 "him, and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish. But a combing\n"
 "sea dashed me off, and at the same instant, the fish, taking one good\n"
 "dart forwards, went down like a flash; and the barb of that cursed\n"
 "second iron towing along near me caught me here\" (clapping his hand\n"
 "just below his shoulder); \"yes, caught me just here, I say, and bore\n"
 "me down to Hell's flames, I was thinking; when, when, all of a sudden,\n"
 "thank the good God, the barb ript its way along the flesh - clear\n"
 "along the whole length of my arm - came out nigh my wrist, and up i\n"
 "floated; - and that gentleman there will tell you the rest (by the\n"
 "way, captain - Dr. Bunger, ship's surgeon: Bunger, my lad, - the\n"
 "captain). Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the yarn.\"  The\n"
 "professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all the\n"
 "time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote his\n"
 "gentlemanly rank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but sober\n"
 "one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and\n"
 "patched trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention between\n"
 "a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in the other,\n"
 "occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two\n"
 "crippled captains. But, at his superior's introduction of him to Ahab,\n"
 "he\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain's\n"
 "bidding.  \"It was a shocking bad wound,\" began the whale-surgeon;\n"
 "\"and, taking my advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy - \"\n"
 "\"Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship,\" interrupted the one-armed\n"
 "captain, addressing Ahab; \"go on, boy\".  \"Stood our old Sammy off to\n"
 "the northward, to get out of the blazing hot weather there on the\n"
 "Line. But it was no use - I did all I could; sat up with him nights;\n"
 "was very severe with him in the matter of diet - \" \"Oh, very severe!\"\n"
 "chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly altering his voice,\n"
 "\"Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night, till he couldn't see to\n"
 "put on the bandages; and sending me to bed, half seas over, about\n"
 "three o'clock in the morning. Oh, ye stars! he sat up with me indeed,\n"
 "and was very severe in my diet. Oh! a great watcher, and very\n"
 "dietetically severe, is Dr. Bunger.  (Bunger, you dog, laugh out! why\n"
 "don't ye? You know you're a precious jolly rascal.) But, heave ahead,\n"
 "boy, I'd rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man.\"\n"
 "\"My captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected Sir\" - said\n"
 "the imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahab - \"is\n"
 "apt to be facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that\n"
 "sort. But I may as well say - en passant, as the French remark - that\n"
 "I myself - that is to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend clergy -\n"
 "am a strict total abstinence man; I never drink - \" \"Water!\" cried the\n"
 "captain; \"he never drinks it; it's a sort of fits to him; fresh water\n"
 "throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on - go on with the arm\n"
 "story.\"  \"Yes, I may as well,\" said the surgeon, coolly. \"I was about\n"
 "observing, Sir, before Captain Boomer's facetious interruption, that\n"
 "spite of my best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse\n"
 "and worse; the truth was, Sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon\n"
 "ever saw; more than two feet and several inches long. I measured it\n"
 "with the lead line. In short, it grew black; I knew what was\n"
 "threatened, and off it came.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there; that\n"
 "thing is against all rule\" - pointing at it with the marlingspike -\n"
 "\"that is the captain's work, not mine; he ordered the carpenter to\n"
 "make it; he had that club-hammer there put to the end, to knock some\n"
 "one's brains out with, I suppose, as he tried mine once.  He flies\n"
 "into diabolical passions sometimes. Do ye see this dent, Sir\" -\n"
 "removing his hat, and brushing aside his hair, and exposing a\n"
 "bowl-like cavity in his skull, but which bore not the slightest scarry\n"
 "trace, or any token of ever having been a wound - \"Well, the captain\n"
 "there will tell you how that came here; he knows.\"  \"No, I don't\",\n"
 "said the captain, \"but his mother did; he was born with it. Oh, you\n"
 "solemn rogue, you - you Bunger! was there ever such another Bunger in\n"
 "the watery world? Bunger, when you die, you ought to die in pickle,\n"
 "you dog; you should be preserved to future ages, you rascal.\"  \"What\n"
 "became of the White Whale?\" now cried Ahab, who thus far had been\n"
 "impatiently listening to this bye-play between the two Englishmen.\n"
 "\"Oh!\" cried the one-armed captain, \"Oh, yes! Well; after he sounded,\n"
 "we didn't see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I\n"
 "didn't then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick,\n"
 "till some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard\n"
 "about Moby Dick - as some call him - and then I knew it was he.\"\n"
 "\"Did'st thou cross his wake again?\"  \"Twice.\"  \"But could not fasten?\"\n"
 "\"Didn't want to try to: ain't one limb enough? What should I do\n"
 "without this other arm? And I'm thinking Moby Dick doesn't bite so\n"
 "much as he swallows.\"  \"Well, then,\" interrupted Bunger, \"give him\n"
 "your left arm for bait to get the right. Do you know, gentlemen\" -\n"
 "very gravely and mathematically bowing to each Captain in succession -\n"
 "\"Do you know, gentlemen, that the digestive organs of the whale are so\n"
 "inscrutably constructed by Divine Providence, that it is quite\n"
 "impossible for him to completely digest even a\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " man's arm? And he knows it too. So that what you take for the\n"
 "White Whale's malice is only his awkwardness. For he never means to\n"
 "swallow a single limb; he only thinks to terrify by feints. But\n"
 "sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of\n"
 "mine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow jack- knives, once upon a\n"
 "time let one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a\n"
 "twelvemonth or more; when I gave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in\n"
 "small tacks, d'ye see. No possible way for him to digest that\n"
 "jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into his general bodily\n"
 "system. Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick enough about it, and\n"
 "have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving\n"
 "decent burial to the other, why in that case the arm is yours; only\n"
 "let the whale have another chance at you shortly, that's all.\"  \"No,\n"
 "thank ye, Bunger,\" said the English captain, \"he's welcome to the arm\n"
 "he has, since I can't help it, and didn't know him then; but not to\n"
 "another one. No more White Whales for me; I've lowered for him once,\n"
 "and that has satisfied me.  There would be great glory in killing him,\n"
 "I know that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him, but,\n"
 "hark ye, he's best let alone; don't you think so, Captain?\" - glancing\n"
 "at the ivory leg.  \"He is. But he will still be hunted, for all\n"
 "that. What is best let alone, that accursed thing is not always what\n"
 "least allures. He's all a magnet! How long since thou saw'st him last?\n"
 "Which way heading?\"  \"Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend's,\"\n"
 "cried Bunger, stoopingly walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely\n"
 "snuffing; \"this man's blood - bring the thermometer; - it's at the\n"
 "boiling point! - his pulse makes these planks beat! - Sir!\" - taking a\n"
 "lancet from his pocket, and drawing near to Ahab's arm.  \"Avast!\"\n"
 "roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks - \"Man the boat! Which\n"
 "way heading?\"  \"Good God!\" cried the English Captain, to whom the\n"
 "question was put. \"What's the matter? He was heading east, I think. -\n"
 "Is your Captain crazy?\" whispering Fedallah.  But Fedallah, putting a\n"
 "finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " to take the boat's steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the\n"
 "cutting- tackle towards him, commanded the ship's sailors to stand by\n"
 "to lower.  In a moment he was standing in the boat's stern, and the\n"
 "Manilla men were springing to their oars. In vain the English Captain\n"
 "hailed him. With back to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint\n"
 "to his own, Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Ere the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here,\n"
 "that she hailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel\n"
 "Enderby, merchant of that city, the original of the famous whaling\n"
 "house of enderby and sons; a house which in my poor whaleman's\n"
 "opinion, comes not far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors\n"
 "and Bourbons, in point of real historical interest. How long, prior to\n"
 "the year of our Lord 1775, this great whaling house was in existence,\n"
 "my numerous fish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775)\n"
 "it fitted out the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the\n"
 "Sperm Whale; though for some score of years previous (ever since 1726)\n"
 "our valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in\n"
 "large fleets pursued that Leviathan, but only in the North and South\n"
 "Atlantic: not elsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here, that the\n"
 "Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized\n"
 "steel the great Sperm Whale; and that for half a century they were the\n"
 "only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him.  In 1778, a fine\n"
 "ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose, and at the sole\n"
 "charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape Horn, and was the\n"
 "first among the nations to lower a whale- boat of any sort in the\n"
 "great South Sea. The\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " voyage was a skilful and lucky one; and returning to her\n"
 "berth with her hold full of the precious sperm, the Amelia's example\n"
 "was soon followed by other ships, English and American, and thus the\n"
 "vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were thrown open. But not\n"
 "content with this good deed, the indefatigable house again bestirred\n"
 "itself: Samuel and all his Sons - how many, their mother only knows -\n"
 "and under their immediate auspices, and partly, I think, at their\n"
 "expense, the British government was induced to send the sloop-of-war\n"
 "Rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South Sea. Commanded\n"
 "by a naval Post-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it, and\n"
 "did some service; how much does not appear. But this is not all. In\n"
 "1819, the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own,\n"
 "to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan. That ship -\n"
 "well called the \"Syren\" - made a noble experimental cruise; and it was\n"
 "thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became generally\n"
 "known. The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a Captain\n"
 "Coffin, a Nantucketer.  All honor to the Enderbies, therefore, whose\n"
 "house, I think, exists to the present day; though doubtless the\n"
 "original Samuel must long ago have slipped his cable for the great\n"
 "South Sea of the other world.  The ship named after him was worthy of\n"
 "the honor, being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way. I\n"
 "boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the Patagonian coast, and\n"
 "drank good flip down in the forecastle. It was a fine gam we had, and\n"
 "they were all trumps - every soul on board. A short life to them, and\n"
 "a jolly death. And that fine gam I had - long, very long after old\n"
 "Ahab touched her planks with his ivory heel - it minds me of the\n"
 "noble, solid, Saxon hospitality of that ship; and may my parson forget\n"
 "me, and the devil remember me, if I ever lose sight of it. Flip? Did I\n"
 "say we had flip? Yes, and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons the\n"
 "hour; and when the squall came (for it's squally off there by\n"
 "Patagonia), and all hands - visitors and all - were called to reef\n"
 "topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each other aloft\n"
 "in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the howling\n"
 "gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However, the masts did\n"
 "not go overboard; and by and bye we scrambled down, so sober, that we\n"
 "had to pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting down\n"
 "the forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to my\n"
 "taste.  The beef was fine - tough, but with body in it. They said it\n"
 "was bull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but i do not know,\n"
 "for certain, how that was. they had dumplings too; small, but\n"
 "substantial, symmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings. I\n"
 "fancied that you could feel them, and roll them about in you after\n"
 "they were swallowed. If you stooped over too far forward, you risked\n"
 "their pitching out of you like billiard-balls. The bread - but that\n"
 "couldn't be helped; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the\n"
 "bread contained the only fresh fare they had. But the forecastle was\n"
 "not very light, and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner\n"
 "when you ate it. But all in all, taking her from truck to helm,\n"
 "considering the dimensions of the cook's boilers, including his own\n"
 "live parchment boilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel Enderby was a\n"
 "jolly ship; of good fare and plenty; fine flip and strong; crack\n"
 "fellows all, and capital from boot heels to hat- band.  But why was\n"
 "it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other English whalers\n"
 "I know of - not all though - were such famous, hospitable ships; that\n"
 "passed round the beef, and the bread, and the can, and the joke; and\n"
 "were not soon weary of eating, and drinking, and laughing? I will tell\n"
 "you. The abounding good cheer of these English whalers is matter for\n"
 "historical research. Nor have I been at all sparing of historical\n"
 "whale research, when it has seemed needed.  The English were preceded\n"
 "in the whale fishery by the Hollanders, Zealanders, and Danes; from\n"
 "whom they derived many terms still extant in the fishery; and what is\n"
 "yet more, their fat old fashions, touching plenty to eat and\n"
 "drink. For, as a general thing, the English merchant-ship scrimps her\n"
 "crew; but not so the English whaler. Hence, in the English, this thing\n"
 "of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural, but incidental and\n"
 "particular; and, therefore, must have some special origin,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " which is here pointed out, and will be still further\n"
 "elucidated.  During my researches in the leviathanic histories, I\n"
 "stumbled upon an ancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling\n"
 "smell of it, I knew must be about whalers. The title was, \"Dan\n"
 "Coopman\", wherefore I concluded that this must be the invaluable\n"
 "memoirs of some Amsterdam cooper in the fishery, as every whale ship\n"
 "must carry its cooper. I was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that\n"
 "it was the production of one \"Fitz Swackhammer\". But my friend\n"
 "Dr. Snodhead, a very learned man, professor of Low Dutch and High\n"
 "German in the college of Santa Claus and St. Pott's, to whom I handed\n"
 "the work for translation, giving him a box of sperm candles for his\n"
 "trouble - this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as he spied the book,\n"
 "assured me that \"Dan Coopman\" did not mean \"The Cooper\", but \"The\n"
 "Merchant\". In short, this ancient and learned Low Dutch book treated\n"
 "of the commerce of Holland; and, among other subjects, contained a\n"
 "very interesting account of its whale fishery. And in this chapter it\n"
 "was, headed \"Smeer\", or \"Fat\", that I found a long detailed list of\n"
 "the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen;\n"
 "from which list, as translated by Dr.  Snodhead. I transcribe the\n"
 "following: 400,000 lbs. of beef. 60,000 lbs.  Friesland pork. 150,000\n"
 "lbs. of stock fish. 550,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000 lbs.  of soft\n"
 "bread. 2,800 firkins of butter. 20,000 lbs. of Texel and Leyden\n"
 "cheese.  144,000 lbs. cheese (probably an inferior article). 550\n"
 "ankers of Geneva. 10,800 barrels of beer.  Most statistical tables are\n"
 "parchingly dry in the reading; not so in the present case, however,\n"
 "where the reader is flooded with whole pipes, barrels, quarts, and\n"
 "gills of good gin and good cheer.  At the time, I devoted three days\n"
 "to the studious digesting of all this beer, beef, and bread, during\n"
 "which many profound\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " thoughts were incidentally suggested to me, capable of a\n"
 "transcendental and Platonic application; and, furthermore, I compiled\n"
 "supplementary tables of my own, touching the probable quantity of\n"
 "stock-fish, &c., consumed by every Low Dutch harpooneer in that\n"
 "ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen whale fishery. In the first place,\n"
 "the amount of butter, and Texel and Leyden cheese consumed, seems\n"
 "amazing. I impute it, though, to their naturally unctuous natures,\n"
 "being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation,\n"
 "and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid Polar\n"
 "Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country where the convivial\n"
 "natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil.  The quantity of\n"
 "beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now, as those polar\n"
 "fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that\n"
 "climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen,\n"
 "including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea, did not\n"
 "much exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each of their\n"
 "fleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all; therefore, I\n"
 "say, we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve\n"
 "weeks' allowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers\n"
 "of gin. Now, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one\n"
 "might fancy them to have been, were the right sort of men to stand up\n"
 "in a boat's head, and take good aim at flying whales; this would seem\n"
 "somewhat improbable. Yet they did aim at them, and hit them too. But\n"
 "this was very far North, be it remembered, where beer agrees well with\n"
 "the constitution; upon the Equator, in our southern fishery, beer\n"
 "would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and boozy\n"
 "in his boat; and grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New\n"
 "Bedford.  But no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch\n"
 "whalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the\n"
 "English whalers have not neglected so excellent an example. For, say\n"
 "they, when cruising in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better\n"
 "out of the world, get a good dinner out of it, at least. And this\n"
 "empties the decanter.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I\n"
 "have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately\n"
 "and in detail upon some few interior structural features. But to a\n"
 "large and thorough sweeping comprehension of him, it behoves me now to\n"
 "unbutton him still further, and untagging the points of his hose,\n"
 "unbuckling his garters, and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of\n"
 "the joints of his innermost bones, set him before you in his\n"
 "ultimatum; that is to say, in his unconditional skeleton.  But how\n"
 "now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the fishery,\n"
 "pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale? Did\n"
 "erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures on the\n"
 "anatomy of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a\n"
 "specimen rib for exhibition?  Explain thyself, Ishmael. Can you land a\n"
 "full-grown whale on your deck for examination, as a cook dishes a\n"
 "roast-pig? Surely not. A veritable witness have you hitherto been,\n"
 "Ishmael; but have a care how you seize the privilege of Jonah alone;\n"
 "the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams; the rafters,\n"
 "ridge-pole, sleepers, and under- pinnings, making up the frame-work of\n"
 "leviathan; and belike of the tallow-vats, dairy-rooms, butteries, and\n"
 "cheeseries in his bowels.  I confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen\n"
 "have penetrated very far beneath the skin of the adult whale;\n"
 "nevertheless, I have been blessed with an opportunity to dissect him\n"
 "in miniature. In a ship I belonged to, a small cub Sperm Whale was\n"
 "once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag, to make sheaths\n"
 "for the barbs of the harpoons, and for the heads of the lances. Think\n"
 "you I let that chance go, without using my boat- hatchet and\n"
 "jack-knife, and breaking the seal and reading all the contents of that\n"
 "young cub?\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan\n"
 "in their gigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge I\n"
 "am indebted to my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of\n"
 "the Arsacides. For being at Tranque, years ago, when attached to the\n"
 "trading-ship Dey of Algiers, I was invited to spend part of the\n"
 "Arsacidean holidays with the lord of Tranque, at his retired palm\n"
 "villa at Pupella; a sea-side glen not very far distant from what our\n"
 "sailors called Bamboo-Town, his capital.  Among many other fine\n"
 "qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being gifted with a devout love\n"
 "for all matters of barbaric vertu, had brought together in Pupella\n"
 "whatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could invent;\n"
 "chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices, chiselled shells, inlaid\n"
 "spears, costly paddles, aromatic canoes; and all these distributed\n"
 "among whatever natural wonders, the wonder-freighted, tribute-\n"
 "rendering waves had cast upon his shores.  Chief among these latter\n"
 "was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an unusually long raging gale,\n"
 "had been found dead and stranded, with his head against a cocoa-nut\n"
 "tree, whose plumage-like, tufted droopings seemed his verdant\n"
 "jet. When the vast body had at last been stripped of its fathom-deep\n"
 "enfoldings, and the bones become dust dry in the sun, then the\n"
 "skeleton was carefully transported up the Pupella glen, where a grand\n"
 "temple of lordly palms now sheltered it.  The ribs were hung with\n"
 "trophies; the vertebrae were carved with Arsacidean annals, in strange\n"
 "hieroglyphics; in the skull, the priests kept up an unextinguished\n"
 "aromatic flame, so that the mystic head again sent forth its vapory\n"
 "spout; while, suspended from a bough, the terrific lower jaw vibrated\n"
 "over all the devotees, like the hair-hung sword that so affrighted\n"
 "Damocles.  It was a wondrous sight. the wood was green as mosses of\n"
 "the icy Glen; the trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living\n"
 "sap; the industrious earth beneath was as a weaver's loom, with a\n"
 "gorgeous carpet on it, whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the\n"
 "warp and woof, and the living flowers the figures. All the trees, with\n"
 "all their laden branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the\n"
 "message-carrying air; all\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " these unceasingly were active. Through the lacings of the\n"
 "leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied\n"
 "verdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver! - pause! - one word! -\n"
 "whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all these\n"
 "ceaseless toilings? Speak, weaver! - stay thy hand! - but one single\n"
 "word with thee! Nay - the shuttle flies - the figures float from forth\n"
 "the loom; the freshet- rushing carpet for ever slides away. The\n"
 "weaver-god, he weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened, that he\n"
 "hears no mortal voice; and by that humming, we, too, who look on the\n"
 "loom are deafened; and only when we escape it shall we hear the\n"
 "thousand voices that speak through it. For even so it is in all\n"
 "material factories. The spoken words that are inaudible among the\n"
 "flying spindles; those same words are plainly heard without the walls,\n"
 "bursting from the opened casements. Thereby have villanies been\n"
 "detected. Ah, mortal! then, be heedful; for so, in all this din of the\n"
 "great world's loom, thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar.\n"
 "Now, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the\n"
 "great, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging - a gigantic idler!\n"
 "Yet, as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed\n"
 "around him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all\n"
 "woven over with the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher\n"
 "verdure; but himself a skeleton. Life folded Death; Death trellised\n"
 "Life; the grim god wived with youthful Life, and begat him\n"
 "curly-headed glories.  Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this\n"
 "wondrous whale, and saw the skull an altar, and the artificial smoke\n"
 "ascending from where the real jet had issued, I marvelled that the\n"
 "king should regard a chapel as an object of vertu. He laughed. But\n"
 "more I marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet of his\n"
 "was genuine. To and fro I paced before this skeleton - brushed the\n"
 "vines aside - broke through the ribs - and with a ball of Arsacidean\n"
 "twine, wandered, eddied long amid its many winding, shaded collonades\n"
 "and arbors. But soon my line was out; and following it back, I emerged\n"
 "from the opening where I entered.  I saw no living thing within;\n"
 "naught was there but bones.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within\n"
 "the skeleton. From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests\n"
 "perceived me taking the altitude of the final rib. \"How now!\" they\n"
 "shouted; \"Dar'st thou measure this our god!  That's for us.\" \"Aye,\n"
 "priests - well, how long do ye make him, then?\" But hereupon a fierce\n"
 "contest rose among them, concerning feet and inches; they cracked each\n"
 "other's sconces with their yard-sticks - the great skull echoed - and\n"
 "seizing that lucky chance, I quickly concluded my own admeasurements.\n"
 "These admeasurements I now propose to set before you. But first, be it\n"
 "recorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied\n"
 "measurement I please.  Because there are skeleton authorities you can\n"
 "refer to, to test my accuracy.  There is a Leviathanic Museum, they\n"
 "tell me, in Hull, England, one of the whaling ports of that country,\n"
 "where they have some fine specimens of fin-backs and other\n"
 "whales. Likewise, I have heard that in the museum of Manchester, in\n"
 "New Hampshire, they have what the proprietors call \"the only perfect\n"
 "specimen of a Greenland or River Whale in the United States.\"\n"
 "Moreover, at a place in Yorkshire, England, Burton Constable by name,\n"
 "a certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession the skeleton of\n"
 "a Sperm Whale, but of moderate size, by no means of the full-grown\n"
 "magnitude of my friend King Tranquo's.  In both cases, the stranded\n"
 "whales to which these two skeletons belonged, were originally claimed\n"
 "by their proprietors upon similar grounds. King Tranquo seizing his\n"
 "because he wanted it; and Sir Clifford, because he was lord of the\n"
 "seignories of those parts. Sir Clifford's whale has been articulated\n"
 "throughout; so that, like a great chest of drawers, you can open and\n"
 "shut him, in all his bony cavities - spread out his ribs like a\n"
 "gigantic fan - and swing all day upon his lower jaw. Locks are to be\n"
 "put upon some of his trap-doors and shutters; and a footman will show\n"
 "round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side. Sir Clifford\n"
 "thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in\n"
 "the spinal column; threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his\n"
 "cerebellum; and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead.\n"
 "The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " copied verbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed;\n"
 "as in my wild wanderings at that period, there was no other secure way\n"
 "of preserving such valuable statistics. But as I was crowded for\n"
 "space, and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page\n"
 "for a poem I was then composing - at least, what untattooed parts\n"
 "might remain - I did not trouble myself with the odd inches; nor,\n"
 "indeed, should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of\n"
 "the whale.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " In the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular,\n"
 "plain statement, touching the living bulk of this Leviathan, whose\n"
 "skeleton we are briefly to exhibit. Such a statement may prove useful\n"
 "here.  According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I\n"
 "partly base upon Captain Scoresby's estimate, of seventy tons for the\n"
 "largest sized Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to my\n"
 "careful calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude,\n"
 "between eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and something less than\n"
 "forty feet in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at\n"
 "least ninety tons; so that reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would\n"
 "considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of\n"
 "one thousand one hundred inhabitants.  Think you not then that brains,\n"
 "like yoked cattle, should be put to this leviathan, to make him at all\n"
 "budge to any landsman's imagination?  Having already in various ways\n"
 "put before you his skull, spout-hole, jaw, teeth, tail, forehead,\n"
 "fins, and divers other parts, I shall now simply point out what is\n"
 "most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed bones. But as\n"
 "the colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of the entire\n"
 "extent\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " of the skeleton; as it is by far the most complicated part;\n"
 "and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter, you\n"
 "must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under your arm, as we\n"
 "proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general\n"
 "structure we are about to view.  In length, the Sperm Whale's skeleton\n"
 "at Tranque measured seventy-two feet; so that when fully invested and\n"
 "extended in life, he must have been ninety feet long; for in the\n"
 "whale, the skeleton loses about one fifth in length compared with the\n"
 "living body. Of this seventy- two feet, his skull and jaw comprised\n"
 "some twenty feet, leaving some fifty feet of plain back-bone. Attached\n"
 "to this back-bone, for something less than a third of its length, was\n"
 "the mighty circular basket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals.  To\n"
 "me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,\n"
 "extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled\n"
 "the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some\n"
 "twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise,\n"
 "for the time, but a long, disconnected timber.  The ribs were ten on a\n"
 "side. The first, to begin from the neck, was nearly six feet long; the\n"
 "second, third, and fourth were each successively longer, till you came\n"
 "to the climax of the fifth, or one of the middle ribs, which measured\n"
 "eight feet and some inches. From that part, the remaining ribs\n"
 "diminished, till the tenth and last only spanned five feet and some\n"
 "inches. In general thickness, they all bore a seemly correspondence to\n"
 "their length. The middle ribs were the most arched. In some of the\n"
 "Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay foot-path bridges\n"
 "over small streams.  In considering these ribs, I could not but be\n"
 "struck anew with the circumstance, so variously repeated in this book,\n"
 "that the skeleton of the whale is by no means the mould of his\n"
 "invested form. The largest of the Tranque ribs, one of the middle\n"
 "ones, occupied that part of the fish which, in life, is greatest in\n"
 "depth. Now, the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular\n"
 "whale must have been at least sixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding\n"
 "rib measured but little more than eight feet. So that this rib only\n"
 "conveyed half of the true notion of the living\n"
 "\n"

 " magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I now\n"
 "saw but a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped round with tons\n"
 "of added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for the\n"
 "ample fins, I here saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of\n"
 "the weighty and majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!  How\n"
 "vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try to\n"
 "comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his dead\n"
 "attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. no. only in the\n"
 "heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his angry\n"
 "flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully invested\n"
 "whale be truly and livingly found out.  But the spine. For that, the\n"
 "best way we can consider it is, with a crane, to pile its bones high\n"
 "up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now it's done, it looks much like\n"
 "Pompey's Pillar.  There are forty and odd vertebrae in all, which in\n"
 "the skeleton are not locked together. They mostly lie like the great\n"
 "knobbed blocks on a Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy\n"
 "masonry. The largest, a middle one, is in width something less than\n"
 "three feet, and in depth more than four. The smallest, where the spine\n"
 "tapers away into the tail, is only two inches in width, and looks\n"
 "something like a white billiard-ball. I was told that there were still\n"
 "smaller ones, but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins,\n"
 "the priest's children, who had stolen them to play marbles with. Thus\n"
 "we see how that the spine of even the hugest of living things tapers\n"
 "off at last into simple child's play.\n"

 " From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme\n"
 "whereon to enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you, you\n"
 "could not compress him. By good rights he\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " should only be treated of in imperial folio. Not to tell over\n"
 "again his furlongs from spiracle to tail, and the yards he measures\n"
 "about the waist; only think of the gigantic involutions of his\n"
 "intestines, where they lie in him like great cables and hausers coiled\n"
 "away in the subterranean orlop-deck of a line-of- battle-ship.  Since\n"
 "I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behoves me to\n"
 "approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not\n"
 "overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him\n"
 "out to the uttermost coil of his bowels. Having already described him\n"
 "in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities, it now\n"
 "remains to magnify him in an archaeological, fossiliferous, and\n"
 "antediluvian point of view. Applied to any other creature than the\n"
 "Leviathan - to an ant or a flea - such portly terms might justly be\n"
 "deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent. But when Leviathan is the text,\n"
 "the case is altered. Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under the\n"
 "weightiest words of the dictionary. And here be it said, that whenever\n"
 "it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these\n"
 "dissertations, I have invariably used a huge quarto edition of\n"
 "Johnson, expressly purchased for that purpose; because that famous\n"
 "lexicographer's uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a\n"
 "lexicon to be used by a whale author like me.  One often hears of\n"
 "writers that rise and swell with their subject, though it may seem but\n"
 "an ordinary one. How, then, with me, writing of this Leviathan?\n"
 "Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard capitals. Give me a\n"
 "condor's quill! Give me Vesuvius' crater for an inkstand! Friends,\n"
 "hold my arms! For in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this\n"
 "Leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with their out-reaching\n"
 "comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the whole circle of the\n"
 "sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men, and mastodons,\n"
 "past, present, and to come, with all the revolving panoramas of empire\n"
 "on earth, and throughout the whole universe, not excluding its\n"
 "suburbs.  Such, and so magnifying, is the virtue of a large and\n"
 "liberal theme! We expand to its bulk. To produce a mighty book, you\n"
 "must choose a\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " mighty theme. No great and enduring volume can ever be\n"
 "written on the flea, though many there be who have tried it.  Ere\n"
 "entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my credentials\n"
 "as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time i have been a\n"
 "stone-mason, and also a great digger of ditches, canals, and wells,\n"
 "wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts. Likewise, by way of\n"
 "preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that while in the earlier\n"
 "geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost\n"
 "completely extinct; the subsequent relics discovered in what are\n"
 "called the Tertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any rate\n"
 "intercepted links, between the antichronical creatures, and those\n"
 "whose remote posterity are said to have entered the Ark; all the\n"
 "Fossil Whales hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period, which\n"
 "is the last preceding the superficial formations. And though none of\n"
 "them precisely answer to any known species of the present time, they\n"
 "are yet sufficiently akin to them in general respects, to justify\n"
 "their taking ranks as Cetacean fossils.  Detached broken fossils of\n"
 "pre-adamite whales, fragments of their bones and skeletons, have\n"
 "within thirty years past, at various intervals, been found at the base\n"
 "of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England, in Scotland, and in\n"
 "the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Among the more\n"
 "curious of such remains is part of a skull, which in the year 1779 was\n"
 "disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris, a short street opening\n"
 "almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries; and bones\n"
 "disinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp, in Napoleon's\n"
 "time. Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some\n"
 "utterly unknown Leviathanic species.  But by far the most wonderful of\n"
 "all cetacean relics was the almost complete vast skeleton of an\n"
 "extinct monster, found in the year 1842, on the plantation of Judge\n"
 "Creagh, in Alabama. The awe-stricken credulous slaves in the vicinity\n"
 "took it for the bones of one of the fallen angels. The Alabama doctors\n"
 "declared it a huge reptile, and bestowed upon it the name of\n"
 "Basilosaurus. But some specimen bones of it being taken across the sea\n"
 "to owen, the english anatomist, it turned out that this alleged\n"
 "reptile was a whale, though of a departed species.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " A significant illustration of the fact, again and again\n"
 "repeated in this book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but\n"
 "little clue to the shape of his fully invested body. So Owen\n"
 "rechristened the monster Zeuglodon; and in his paper read before the\n"
 "London Geological Society, pronounced it, in substance, one of the\n"
 "most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have\n"
 "blotted out of existence.  When I stand among these mighty Leviathan\n"
 "skeletons, skulls, tusks, jaws, ribs, and vertebrae, all characterized\n"
 "by partial resemblances to the existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at\n"
 "the same time bearing on the other hand similar affinities to the\n"
 "annihilated antichronical Leviathans, their incalculable seniors; I\n"
 "am, by a flood, borne back to that wondrous period, ere time itself\n"
 "can be said to have begun; for time began with man. Here Saturn's grey\n"
 "chaos rolls over me, and I obtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those\n"
 "Polar eternities; when wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what\n"
 "are now the Tropics; and in all the 25,000 miles of this world's\n"
 "circumference, not an inhabitable hand's breadth of land was\n"
 "visible. Then the whole world was the whale's; and, king of creation,\n"
 "he left his wake along the present lines of the Andes and the\n"
 "Himmalehs. Who can show a pedigree like Leviathan? Ahab's harpoon had\n"
 "shed older blood than the Pharaoh's. Methuselah seems a school-boy. I\n"
 "look round to shake hands with Shem. I am horror-struck at this\n"
 "antemosaic, unsourced existence of the unspeakable terrors of the\n"
 "whale, which, having been before all time, must needs exist after all\n"
 "humane ages are over.  But not alone has this Leviathan left his\n"
 "pre-adamite traces in the stereotype plates of nature, and in\n"
 "limestone and marl bequeathed his ancient bust; but upon Egyptian\n"
 "tablets, whose antiquity seems to claim for them an almost\n"
 "fossiliferous character, we find the unmistakable print of his fin. In\n"
 "an apartment of the great temple of Denderah, some fifty years ago,\n"
 "there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted\n"
 "planisphere, abounding in centaurs, griffins, and dolphins, similar to\n"
 "the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the moderns. Gliding\n"
 "among them, old Leviathan swam as of yore; was there swimming in that\n"
 "planisphere, centuries before Solomon was cradled.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the\n"
 "antiquity of the whale, in his own osseous post-diluvian reality, as\n"
 "set down by the venerable John Leo, the old Barbary traveller.  \"Not\n"
 "far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams of\n"
 "which are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a monstrous size are\n"
 "oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore. The Common People imagine,\n"
 "that by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the Temple, no Whale can\n"
 "pass it without immediate death. But the truth of the Matter is, that\n"
 "on either side of the Temple, there are Rocks that shoot two Miles\n"
 "into the Sea, and wound the Whales when they light upon 'em.  They\n"
 "keep a Whale's Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle, which lying\n"
 "upon the Ground with its convex part uppermost, makes an Arch, the\n"
 "Head of which cannot be reached by a Man upon a Camel's Back. This Rib\n"
 "(says John Leo) is said to have layn there a hundred Years before I\n"
 "saw it. Their Historians affirm, that a Prophet who prophesy'd of\n"
 "Mahomet, came from this Temple, and some do not stand to assert, that\n"
 "the Prophet Jonas was cast forth by the Whale at the Base of the\n"
 "Temple.\"  In this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you, reader, and\n"

 "DIMINISH? - WILL HE\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Inasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon\n"
 "us from the head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired,\n"
 "whether, in the long course of his generations, he has not degenerated\n"
 "from the original bulk of his sires.  But upon investigation we find,\n"
 "that not only are the whales of the present day superior in magnitude\n"
 "to those whose fossil remains are found in the Tertiary system\n"
 "(embracing a distinct geological period prior to man), but of the\n"
 "whales found in that\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Tertiary system, those belonging to its latter formations\n"
 "exceed in size those of its earlier ones.  Of all the pre- adamite\n"
 "whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the Alabama one mentioned in\n"
 "the last chapter, and that was less than seventy feet in length in the\n"
 "skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen, that the tape-measure gives\n"
 "seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale. And I\n"
 "have heard, on whalemen's authority, that Sperm Whales have been\n"
 "captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture.  But may it\n"
 "not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in\n"
 "magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may it not\n"
 "be, that since Adam's time they have degenerated?  Assuredly, we must\n"
 "conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as\n"
 "Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For Pliny tells us of\n"
 "whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and Aldrovandus of others\n"
 "which measured eight hundred feet in length - Rope Walks and Thames\n"
 "Tunnels of Whales!  And even in the days of Banks and Solander,\n"
 "Cooke's naturalists, we find a Danish member of the Academy of\n"
 "Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales (reydan-siskur, or\n"
 "Wrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards; that is, three\n"
 "hundred and sixty feet. And Lacepede, the French naturalist, in his\n"
 "elaborate history of whales, in the very beginning of his work (page\n"
 "3), sets down the Right Whale at one hundred metres, three hundred and\n"
 "twenty-eight feet.  And this work was published so late as A. D. 1825.\n"
 "But will any whaleman believe these stories? No. The whale of to-day\n"
 "is as big as his ancestors in Pliny's time. And if ever I go where\n"
 "Pliny is, I, a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to tell him\n"
 "so. Because I cannot understand how it is, that while the Egyptian\n"
 "mummies that were buried thousands of years before even Pliny was\n"
 "born, do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian\n"
 "in his socks; and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the\n"
 "oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the relative proportions in\n"
 "which they are drawn, just as plainly prove that the high-bred,\n"
 "stall-fed, prize cattle of Smithfield, not only equal, but far exceed\n"
 "in magnitude the fattest of Pharaoh's fat kine; in the face of\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " all this, I will not admit that of all animals the whale\n"
 "alone should have degenerated.  But still another inquiry remains; one\n"
 "often agitated by the more recondite Nantucketers. Whether owing to\n"
 "the almost omniscient look-outs at the mast-heads of the whale-ships,\n"
 "now penetrating even through Behring's straits, and into the remotest\n"
 "secret drawers and lockers of the world; and the thousand harpoons and\n"
 "lances darted along all continental coasts; the moot point is, whether\n"
 "Leviathan can long endure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc;\n"
 "whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters, and the\n"
 "last whale, like the last man, smoke his last pipe, and then himself\n"
 "evaporate in the final puff.  Comparing the humped herds of whales\n"
 "with the humped herds of buffalo, which, not forty years ago,\n"
 "overspread by tens of thousands the prairies of Illinois and Missouri,\n"
 "and shook their iron manes and scowled with their thunder-clotted\n"
 "brows upon the sites of populous river- capitals, where now the polite\n"
 "broker sells you land at a dollar an inch; in such a comparison an\n"
 "irresistible argument would seem furnished, to show that the hunted\n"
 "whale cannot now escape speedy extinction.  But you must look at this\n"
 "matter in every light. Though so short a period ago - not a good\n"
 "life-time - the census of the buffalo in Illinois exceeded the census\n"
 "of men now in London, and though at the present day not one horn or\n"
 "hoof of them remains in all that region; and though the cause of this\n"
 "wondrous extermination was the spear of man; yet the far different\n"
 "nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an end to\n"
 "the Leviathan. Forty men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whale for\n"
 "forty-eight months think they have done extremely well, and thank God,\n"
 "if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish.  Whereas, in the\n"
 "days of the old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West,\n"
 "when the far west (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness\n"
 "and a virgin, the same number of moccasined men, for the same number\n"
 "of months, mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships, would have\n"
 "slain not forty, but forty thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that,\n"
 "if need were, could be statistically stated.  Nor, considered aright,\n"
 "does it seem any argument in favor\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " of the gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example,\n"
 "that in former years (the latter part of the last century, say) these\n"
 "Leviathans, in small pods, were encountered much oftener than at\n"
 "present, and, in consequence, the voyages were not so prolonged, and\n"
 "were also much more remunerative. Because, as has been elsewhere\n"
 "noticed, those whales, influenced by some views to safety, now swim\n"
 "the seas in immense caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered\n"
 "solitaries, yokes, and pods, and schools of other days are now\n"
 "aggregated into vast but widely separated, unfrequent armies. That is\n"
 "all. And equally fallacious seems the conceit, that because the\n"
 "so-called whale-bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former\n"
 "years abounding with them, hence that species also is declining. For\n"
 "they are only being driven from promontory to cape; and if one coast\n"
 "is no longer enlivened with their jets, then, be sure, some other and\n"
 "remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar\n"
 "spectacle.  Furthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans,\n"
 "they have two firm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will\n"
 "for ever remain impregnable.  And as upon the invasion of their\n"
 "valleys, the frosty Swiss have retreated to their mountains; so,\n"
 "hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas, the whale-bone\n"
 "whales can at last resort to their Polar citadels, and diving under\n"
 "the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there, come up among icy fields\n"
 "and floes; and in a charmed circle of everlasting December, bid\n"
 "defiance to all pursuit from man.  But as perhaps fifty of these\n"
 "whale-bone whales are harpooned for one cachalot, some philosophers of\n"
 "the forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc has already\n"
 "very seriously diminished their battalions. But though for some time\n"
 "past a number of these whales, not less than 13,000 have been annually\n"
 "slain on the nor' west coast by the Americans alone; yet there are\n"
 "considerations which render even this circumstance of little or no\n"
 "account as an opposing argument in this matter.  Natural as it is to\n"
 "be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of the more\n"
 "enormous creatures of the globe, yet what shall we say to Harto, the\n"
 "historian of Goa, when he tells us that at one hunting the King of\n"
 "Siam took 4000 elephants;\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves of\n"
 "cattle in the temperate climes. And there seems no reason to doubt\n"
 "that if these elephants, which have now been hunted for thousands of\n"
 "years, by Semiramis, by Porus, by hannibal, and by all the successive\n"
 "monarchs of the East - if they still survive there in great numbers,\n"
 "much more may the great whale outlast all hunting, since he has a\n"
 "pasture to expatiate in, which is precisely twice as large as all\n"
 "Asia, both Americas, Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the Isles\n"
 "of the sea combined.  Moreover: we are to consider, that from the\n"
 "presumed great longevity of whales, their probably attaining the age\n"
 "of a century and more, therefore at any one period of time, several\n"
 "distinct adult generations must be contemporary. And what that is, we\n"
 "may soon gain some idea of, by imagining all the grave-yards,\n"
 "cemeteries, and family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies\n"
 "of all the men, women, and children who were alive seventy-five years\n"
 "ago; and adding this countless host to the present human population of\n"
 "the globe.  Wherefore, for all these things, we account the whale\n"
 "immortal in his species, however perishable in his individuality. He\n"
 "swam the seas before the continents broke water; he once swam over the\n"
 "site of the Tuileries, and Windsor Castle, and the Kremlin. In Noah's\n"
 "flood, he despised Noah's Ark; and if ever the world is to be again\n"
 "flooded, like the Netherlands, to kill off its rats, then the eternal\n"
 "whale will still survive, and rearing upon the topmost crest of the\n"
 "equatorial flood, spout his frothed defiance to the skies.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted\n"
 "the Samuel Enderby of London, had not been unattended with some small\n"
 "violence to his own person. He had lighted with such energy upon a\n"
 "thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " received a half-splintering shock. And when after gaining his\n"
 "own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he so vehemently wheeled round\n"
 "with an urgent command to the steersman (it was, as ever, something\n"
 "about his not steering inflexibly enough); then, the already shaken\n"
 "ivory received such an additional twist and wrench, that though it\n"
 "still remained entire, and to all appearances lusty, yet Ahab did not\n"
 "deem it entirely trustworthy.  And, indeed, it seemed small matter for\n"
 "wonder, that for all his pervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at\n"
 "times give careful heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which\n"
 "he partly stood. For it had not been very long prior to the Pequod's\n"
 "sailing from Nantucket, that he had been found one night lying prone\n"
 "upon the ground, and insensible; by some unknown, and seemingly\n"
 "inexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his ivory limb having been so\n"
 "violently displaced, that it had stake-wise smitten, and all but\n"
 "pierced his groin; nor was it without extreme difficulty that the\n"
 "agonizing wound was entirely cured.  Nor, at the time, had it failed\n"
 "to enter his monomaniac mind, that all the anguish of that then\n"
 "present suffering was but the direct issue of a former woe; and he too\n"
 "plainly seemed to see, that as the most poisonous reptile of the marsh\n"
 "perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the\n"
 "grove; so, equally with every felicity, all miserable events do\n"
 "naturally beget their like. Yea, more than equally, thought Ahab;\n"
 "since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief go further than the\n"
 "ancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not to hint of this: that it is an\n"
 "inference from certain canonic teachings, that while some natural\n"
 "enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other\n"
 "world, but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the\n"
 "joy-childlessness of all hell's despair; whereas, some guilty mortal\n"
 "miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally\n"
 "progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave; not at all to hint of\n"
 "this, there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the\n"
 "thing. For, thought Ahab, while even the highest earthly felicities\n"
 "ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them, but, at\n"
 "bottom, all heart-woes, a mystic significance, and, in some men, an\n"
 "archangelic grandeur; so do their diligent tracings-out not belie the\n"
 "obvious deduction. To trail the genealogies\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " of these high mortal miseries, carries us at last among the\n"
 "sourceless primogenitures of the gods; so that, in the face of all the\n"
 "glad, hay-making suns, and soft-cymballing, round harvest- moons, we\n"
 "must needs give in to this: that the gods themselves are not for ever\n"
 "glad. The ineffaceable, sad birth-mark in the brow of man, is but the\n"
 "stamp of sorrow in the signers.  Unwittingly here a secret has been\n"
 "divulged, which perhaps might more properly, in set way, have been\n"
 "disclosed before. With many other particulars concerning Ahab, always\n"
 "had it remained a mystery to some, why it was, that for a certain\n"
 "period, both before and after the sailing of the Pequod, he had hidden\n"
 "himself away with such Grand-Lama-like exclusiveness; and, for that\n"
 "one interval, sought speechless refuge, as it were, among the marble\n"
 "senate of the dead. Captain Peleg's bruited reason for this thing\n"
 "appeared by no means adequate; though, indeed, as touching all Ahab's\n"
 "deeper part, every revelation partook more of significant darkness\n"
 "than of explanatory light. But, in the end, it all came out; this one\n"
 "matter did, at least. That direful mishap was at the bottom of his\n"
 "temporary recluseness. And not only this, but to that\n"
 "ever-contracting, dropping circle ashore, who, for any reason,\n"
 "possessed the privilege of a less banned approach to him; to that\n"
 "timid circle the above hinted casualty - remaining, as it did, moodily\n"
 "unaccounted for by Ahab - invested itself with terrors, not entirely\n"
 "underived from the land of spirits and of wails. So that, through\n"
 "their zeal for him, they had all conspired, so far as in them lay, to\n"
 "muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others; and hence it was,\n"
 "that not till a considerable interval had elapsed, did it transpire\n"
 "upon the Pequod's decks.  But be all this as it may; let the unseen,\n"
 "ambiguous synod in the air, or the vindictive princes and potentates\n"
 "of fire, have to do or not with earthly Ahab, yet, in this present\n"
 "matter of his leg, he took plain practical procedures; - he called the\n"
 "carpenter.  And when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him\n"
 "without delay set about making a new leg, and directed the mates to\n"
 "see him supplied with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm\n"
 "Whale) which had thus far been accumulated\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " on the voyage, in order that a careful selection of the\n"
 "stoutest, clearest-grained stuff might be secured. This done, the\n"
 "carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night; and to\n"
 "provide all the fittings for it, independent of those pertaining to\n"
 "the distrusted one in use. Moreover, the ship's forge was ordered to\n"
 "be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold; and, to\n"
 "accelerate the affair, the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once\n"
 "to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed.\n"

 "hereditary. But most humble though he was, and far from furnishing an\n"

 " eyes in the deck, or new tree-nails in the side planks, and\n"
 "other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special\n"
 "business; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of\n"
 "conflicting aptitudes, both useful and capricious.  The one grand\n"
 "stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold, was his\n"
 "vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vices,\n"
 "of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood. At all times except\n"
 "when whales were alongside, this bench was securely lashed\n"
 "athwartships against the rear of the try-works.  A belaying pin is\n"
 "found too large to be easily inserted into its hole: the carpenter\n"
 "claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and straightway files it\n"
 "smaller. A lost land-bird of strange plumage strays on board, and is\n"
 "made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of right-whale bone, and\n"
 "cross- beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter makes a\n"
 "pagoda-looking cage for it. An oarsman sprains his wrist: the\n"
 "carpenter concocts a soothing lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion\n"
 "stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar; screwing each oar\n"
 "in his big vice of wood, the carpenter symmetrically supplies the\n"
 "constellation. A sailor takes a fancy to wear shark-bone ear- rings:\n"
 "the carpenter drills his ears. Another has the toothache: the\n"
 "carpenter out pincers, and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him\n"
 "be seated there; but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the\n"
 "unconcluded operation; whirling round the handle of his wooden vice,\n"
 "the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that, if he would have him\n"
 "draw the tooth.  Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and\n"
 "alike indifferent and without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits\n"
 "of ivory; heads he deemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly\n"
 "held for capstans. But while now upon so wide a field thus variously\n"
 "accomplished, and with such liveliness of expertness in him, too; all\n"
 "this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence. But\n"
 "not precisely so. For nothing was this man more remarkable, than for a\n"
 "certain impersonal stolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it so\n"
 "shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things, that it seemed one\n"
 "with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world;\n"
 "which while\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " pauselessly active in uncounted modes, still eternally holds\n"
 "its peace, and ignores you, though you dig foundations for\n"
 "cathedrals. Yet was this half-horrible stolidity in him, involving,\n"
 "too, as it appeared, an all-ramifying heartlessness; - yet was it\n"
 "oddly dashed at times, with an old, crutch-like, antediluvian,\n"
 "wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now and then with a certain\n"
 "grizzled wittiness; such as might have served to pass the time during\n"
 "the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of Noah's ark. Was it\n"
 "that this old carpenter had been a life-long wanderer, whose much\n"
 "rolling, to and fro, not only had gathered no moss; but what is more,\n"
 "had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings might have originally\n"
 "pertained to him? He was a stript abstract; an unfractioned integral;\n"
 "uncompromised as a new-born babe; living without premeditated\n"
 "reference to this world or the next. You might almost say, that this\n"
 "strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence;\n"
 "for in his numerous trades, he did not seem to work so much by reason\n"
 "or by instinct, or simply because he had been tutored to it, or by any\n"
 "intermixture of all these, even or uneven; but merely by a kind of\n"
 "deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal process. He was a pure manipulator;\n"
 "his brain, if he had ever had one, must have early oozed along into\n"
 "the muscles of his fingers. He was like one of those unreasoning but\n"
 "still highly useful, multum in parvo, Sheffield contrivances, assuming\n"
 "the exterior - though a little swelled - of a common pocket knife; but\n"
 "containing, not only blades of various sizes, but also screw-drivers,\n"
 "cork-screws, tweezers, awls, pens, rulers, nail-filers,\n"
 "counter-sinkers. So, if his superiors wanted to use the carpenter for\n"
 "a screw-driver, all they had to do was to open that part of him, and\n"
 "the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him up by the legs, and\n"
 "there they were.  Yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled,\n"
 "open-and-shut carpenter, was, after all, no mere machine of an\n"
 "automaton. If he did not have a common soul in him, he had a subtle\n"
 "something that somehow anomalously did its duty. What that was,\n"
 "whether essence of quicksilver, or a few drops of hartshorn, there is\n"
 "no telling. But there it was; and there it had abided for now some\n"
 "sixty years or more. And this it was, this same\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " unaccountable, cunning life-principle in him; this it was,\n"
 "that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing; but only like an\n"
 "unreasoning wheel, which also hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his\n"
 "body was a sentry-box and this soliloquizer on guard there, and\n"
 "talking all the time to keep himself awake.\n"

 "Ahab Advancing During the ensuing scene, the carpenter continues\n"
 "sneezing at times.  Well, manmaker!  Just in time, Sir. If the captain\n"
 "pleases, I will now mark the length. Let me measure, Sir.  Measured\n"
 "for a leg! good. Well, it's not the first time. About it! There; keep\n"

 "feel something in this slippery world that can hold, man. What's\n"
 "Prometheus about there? - the blacksmith, I mean - what's he about?\n"
 "He must be forging the buckle- screw, Sir, now.  Right. It's a\n"
 "partnership; he supplies the muscle part. He makes a fierce red flame\n"
 "there!  Aye, Sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine\n"
 "work.  Um-um. So he must. I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that\n"
 "that old Greek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a\n"

 "This must be the remainder the Greek made the Africans of. Carpenter,\n"

 "- Clay? clay, Sir? That's mud; we leave clay to ditchers, Sir.  The\n"

 "Sir.  Take the hint, then; and when thou art dead, never bury thyself\n"
 "under living people's noses.  Sir? - oh! ah! - I guess so; so; - yes,\n"
 "yes - oh dear!  Look ye, carpenter, I dare say thou callest thyself a\n"
 "right good workmanlike workman, eh! Well, then, will it speak\n"
 "thoroughly well for thy work, if, when I come to mount this leg thou\n"
 "makest, I shall nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical\n"
 "place with it; that is, carpenter, my old lost leg; the flesh and\n"
 "blood one, I mean. Canst thou not drive that old Adam away?  Truly,\n"
 "Sir, I begin to understand somewhat now. Yes, I have heard something\n"
 "curious on that score, Sir; how that a dismasted man never entirely\n"
 "loses the feeling of his old spar, but it will be still pricking him\n"
 "at times. May I humbly ask if it be really so, Sir?  It is, man. Look,\n"
 "put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was; so, now, here\n"
 "is only one distinct leg to the eye,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " yet two to the soul. Where thou feelest tingling life; there,\n"
 "exactly there, there to a hair, do I. Is't a riddle?  I should humbly\n"
 "call it a poser, Sir.  Hist, then. How dost thou know that some\n"
 "entire, living, thinking thing may not be invisibly and\n"
 "uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where thou now standest; aye,\n"
 "and standing there in thy spite? In thy most solitary hours, then,\n"
 "dost thou not fear eavesdroppers? Hold, don't speak! And if I still\n"
 "feel the smart of my crushed leg, though it be now so long dissolved;\n"
 "then, why mayest not thou, carpenter, feel the fiery pains of hell for\n"
 "ever, and without a body? Hah!  Good Lord! Truly, Sir, if it comes to\n"
 "that, I must calculate over again; I think I didn't carry a small\n"
 "figure, Sir.  Look ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises. -\n"
 "How long before this leg is done?  Perhaps an hour, Sir.  Bungle away\n"
 "at it then, and bring it to me (turns to go). Oh, Life! Here I am,\n"
 "proud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for a\n"
 "bone to stand on! Cursed be that mortal inter-indebtedness which will\n"
 "not do away with ledgers. I would be free as air; and I'm down in the\n"
 "whole world's books. I am so rich, I could have given bid for bid with\n"
 "the wealthiest Praetorians at the auction of the Roman empire (which\n"
 "was the world's); and yet I owe for the flesh in the tongue I brag\n"
 "with. By heavens! I'll get a crucible, and into it, and dissolve\n"
 "myself down to one small, compendious vertebra. So.  Carpenter\n"
 "Resuming his work Well, well, well! Stubb knows him best of all, and\n"
 "Stubb always says he's queer; says nothing but that one sufficient\n"
 "little word queer; he's queer, says Stubb; he's queer - queer, queer;\n"
 "and keeps dinning it into Mr. Starbuck all the time - queer, Sir -\n"
 "queer, queer, very queer. And here's his leg! Yes, now that I think of\n"
 "it, here's his bedfellow! has a stick of whale's jaw-bone for a wife!\n"
 "And this is his leg; he'll stand on this. What was that now about one\n"
 "leg standing in three places, and all three places standing in one\n"
 "hell - how was that? Oh! I don't wonder he looked so scornful at me!\n"
 "I'm a sort of strange- thoughted\n"

 "\n"
 " sometimes, they say; but that's only haphazard-like. Then, a\n"
 "short, little old body like me, should never undertake to wade out\n"
 "into deep waters with tall, heron-built captains; the water chucks you\n"
 "under the chin pretty quick, and there's a great cry for life-\n"
 "boats. And here's the heron's leg! long and slim, sure enough! Now,\n"
 "for most folks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime, and that must be\n"
 "because they use them mercifully, as a tender-hearted old lady uses\n"
 "her roly-poly old coach-horses. But Ahab; oh he's a hard driver. Look,\n"
 "driven one leg to death, and spavined the other for life, and now\n"
 "wears out bone legs by the cord. Halloa, there, you Smut! bear a hand\n"
 "there with those screws, and let's finish it before the resurrection\n"
 "fellow comes a-calling with his horn for all legs, true or false, as\n"
 "brewery-men go round collecting old beer barrels, to fill 'em up\n"
 "again. What a leg this is! It looks like a real live leg, filed down\n"
 "to nothing but the core; he'll be standing on this to-morrow; he'll be\n"
 "taking altitudes on it. Halloa! I almost forgot the little oval slate,\n"
 "smoothed ivory, where he figures up the latitude. So, so; chisel,\n"

 "\n"
 " According to usage they were pumping the ship next morning;\n"
 "and lo! no inconsiderable oil came up with the water; the casks below\n"
 "must have sprung a bad leak. Much concern was shown; and Starbuck went\n"
 "down into the cabin to report this unfavorable affair.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Now, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to\n"
 "Formosa and the Bashee Isles, between which lies one of the tropical\n"
 "outlets from the China waters into the Pacific. And so Starbuck found\n"
 "Ahab with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before\n"
 "him; and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of\n"
 "the Japanese islands - Niphon, Matsmai, and Sikoke.  With his\n"
 "snow-white new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table,\n"
 "and with a long pruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondrous\n"
 "old man, with his back to the gangway door, was wrinkling his brow,\n"
 "and tracing his old courses again.  \"Who's there?\" hearing the\n"
 "footstep at the door, but not turning round to it.  \"On deck! Begone!\"\n"
 "\"Captain Ahab mistakes; it is I. The oil in the hold is leaking,\n"
 "Sir. We must up Burtons and break out.\"  \"Up Burtons and break out?\n"
 "Now that we are nearing Japan; heave-to here for a week to tinker a\n"
 "parcel of old hoops?\"  \"Either do that, Sir, or waste in one day more\n"
 "oil than we may make good in a year. What we come twenty thousand\n"
 "miles to get is worth saving, Sir.\"  \"So it is, so it is; if we get\n"
 "it.\"  \"I was speaking of the oil in the hold, Sir.\"  \"And I was not\n"
 "speaking or thinking of that at all. Begone! Let it leak! I'm all\n"
 "aleak myself. Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of leaky casks, but\n"
 "those leaky casks are in a leaky ship; and that's a far worse plight\n"
 "than the Pequod's, man.  Yet I don't stop to plug my leak; for who can\n"
 "find it in the deep-loaded hull; or how hope to plug it, even if\n"
 "found, in this life's howling gale? Starbuck!  I'll not have the\n"
 "Burtons hoisted.\"  \"What will the owners say, Sir?\"  \"Let the owners\n"
 "stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons. What cares Ahab?\n"
 "Owners, owners? Thou art always prating to me, Starbuck, about those\n"
 "miserly owners, as if the owners were my conscience. But look ye, the\n"
 "only real owner of anything is its commander; and hark ye, my\n"
 "conscience is in this ship's keel. - On deck!\"  \"Captain Ahab,\" said\n"
 "the reddening mate, moving further into the cabin, with a daring so\n"
 "strangely respectful and cautious that\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " it almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the\n"
 "slightest outward manifestation of itself, but within also seemed more\n"
 "than half distrustful of itself; \"A better man than I might well pass\n"
 "over in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man;\n"
 "aye! and in a happier, Captain Ahab.\"  \"Devils! Dost thou then so much\n"
 "as dare to critically think of me? - On deck!\"  \"Nay, Sir, not yet; I\n"
 "do entreat. And I do dare, Sir - to be forbearing! Shall we not\n"
 "understand each other better than hitherto, Captain Ahab?\"  Ahab\n"
 "seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of most\n"
 "South-Sea-men's cabin furniture), and pointing it towards Starbuck,\n"
 "exclaimed: \"There is one God that is Lord over the earth, and one\n"
 "Captain that is lord over the Pequod. - On deck!\"  For an instant in\n"
 "the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery cheeks, you would have\n"
 "almost thought that he had really received the blaze of the levelled\n"
 "tube.  But, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose, and as he\n"
 "quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and said: \"Thou hast\n"
 "outraged, not insulted me, Sir; but for that I ask thee not to beware\n"
 "of Starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab beware of Ahab;\n"
 "beware of thyself, old man.\"  \"He waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys;\n"
 "most careful bravery that!\" murmured Ahab, as Starbuck\n"
 "disappeared. \"What's that he said - Ahab beware of Ahab - there's\n"
 "something there!\" Then unconsciously using the musket for a staff,\n"
 "with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin; but\n"
 "presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed, and returning the\n"
 "gun to the rack, he went to the deck.  \"Thou art but too good a\n"
 "fellow, Starbuck,\" he said lowly to the mate; then raising his voice\n"
 "to the crew: \"Furl the t'gallant-sails and close-reef the top-sails,\n"
 "fore and aft; back the main-yard; up Burtons, and break out in the\n"
 "main- hold.\"  It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that\n"
 "as respecting Starbuck, Ahab thus acted. It may have been a flash of\n"
 "honesty in him; or mere prudential policy which, under the\n"
 "circumstance, imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open\n"
 "disaffection, however transient, in the important chief\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " officer of his ship. However it was, his orders were\n"
 "executed; and the Burtons were hoisted. In Sperm-whalemen with any\n"
 "considerable quantity of oil on board, it is a regular semi-weekly\n"
 "duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and drench the casks with\n"
 "sea-water; which afterwards, at varying intervals, is removed by the\n"
 "ship's pumps. Hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight;\n"
 "while by the changed character of the withdrawn water, the mariners\n"
 "readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Upon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into\n"
 "the hold were perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further\n"
 "off. So, it being calm weather, they broke out deeper and deeper,\n"
 "disturbing the slumbers of the huge ground-tier butts; and from that\n"
 "black midnight sending those gigantic moles into the daylight\n"
 "above. So deep did they go; and so ancient, and corroded, and weedy\n"
 "the aspect of the lowermost puncheons, that you almost looked next for\n"
 "some mouldy corner-stone cask containing coins of Captain Noah, with\n"
 "copies of the posted placards, vainly warning the infatuated old world\n"
 "from the flood.  Tierce after tierce, too, of water, and bread, and\n"
 "beef, and shooks of staves, and iron bundles of hoops, were hoisted\n"
 "out, till at last the piled decks were hard to get about; and the\n"
 "hollow hull echoed under foot, as if you were treading over empty\n"
 "catacombs, and reeled and rolled in the sea like an air-freighted\n"
 "demijohn. Top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all\n"
 "Aristotle in his head. Well was it that the Typhoons did not visit\n"
 "them then.  Now, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and\n"
 "fast bosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought\n"
 "him nigh to his endless end.  Be it said, that in this vocation of\n"
 "whaling, sinecures are unknown; dignity and danger go hand in hand;\n"
 "till you get to be Captain, the higher you rise the harder you\n"
 "toil. So with poor Queequeg, who, as harpooneer, must not only face\n"
 "all the rage of the living whale, but - as we have elsewhere seen -\n"
 "mount his dead back in a rolling sea; and finally descend into the\n"
 "gloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating all day in that\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the clumsiest\n"
 "casks and see to their stowage. To be short, among whalemen, the\n"
 "harpooneers are the holders, so called.  Poor Queequeg! when the ship\n"
 "was about half disembowelled, you should have stooped over the\n"
 "hatchway, and peered down upon him there; where, stripped to his\n"
 "woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that\n"
 "dampness and slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a\n"
 "well. And a well, or an ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor\n"
 "pagan; where, strange to say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he\n"
 "caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever; and at last, after\n"
 "some days' suffering, laid him in his hammock, close to the very sill\n"
 "of the door of death. How he wasted and wasted away in those few\n"
 "long-lingering days, till there seemed but little left of him but his\n"
 "frame and tattooing. But as all else in him thinned, and his\n"
 "cheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless, seemed growing\n"
 "fuller and fuller; they became of a strange softness of lustre; and\n"
 "mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness, a\n"
 "wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die,\n"
 "or be weakened. And like circles on the water, which, as they grow\n"
 "fainter, expand; so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding, like the\n"
 "rings of Eternity. An awe that cannot be named would steal over you as\n"
 "you sat by the side of this waning savage, and saw as strange things\n"
 "in his face, as any beheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster\n"
 "died. For whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man, never yet was\n"
 "put into words or books. And the drawing near of Death, which alike\n"
 "levels all, alike impresses all with a last revelation, which only an\n"
 "author from the dead could adequately tell. So that - let us say it\n"
 "again - no dying Chaldee or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than\n"
 "those, whose mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor\n"
 "Queequeg, as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock, and the rolling\n"
 "sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest, and the ocean's\n"
 "invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined\n"
 "heaven.  Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg\n"
 "himself, what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious\n"
 "favor he asked. He called one to him in the grey\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " morning watch, when the day was just breaking, and taking his\n"
 "hand, said that while in Nantucket he had chanced to see certain\n"
 "little canoes of dark wood, like the rich war-wood of his native isle;\n"
 "and upon inquiry, he had learned that all whalemen who died in\n"
 "Nantucket, were laid in those same dark canoes, and that the fancy of\n"
 "being so laid had much pleased him; for it was not unlike the custom\n"
 "of his own race, who, after embalming a dead warrior, stretched him\n"
 "out in his canoe, and so left him to be floated away to the starry\n"
 "archipelagoes; for not only do they believe that the stars are isles,\n"
 "but that far beyond all visible horizons, their own mild,\n"
 "uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue heavens; and so form the\n"
 "white breakers of the milky way. He added, that he shuddered at the\n"
 "thought of being buried in his hammock, according to the usual\n"
 "sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the death- devouring\n"
 "sharks. No: he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket, all the more\n"
 "congenial to him, being a whaleman, that like a whale-boat these\n"
 "coffin-canoes were without a keel; though that involved but uncertain\n"
 "steering, and much lee-way adown the dim ages.  Now, when this strange\n"
 "circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter was at once commanded\n"
 "to do Queequeg's bidding, whatever it might include. There was some\n"
 "heathenish, coffin-colored old lumber aboard, which, upon a long\n"
 "previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the\n"
 "Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks the coffin was\n"
 "recommended to be made. No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the\n"
 "order, than taking his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent\n"
 "promptitude of his character, proceeded into the forecastle and took\n"
 "Queequeg's measure with great accuracy, regularly chalking Queequeg's\n"
 "person as he shifted the rule.  \"Ah! poor fellow! he'll have to die\n"
 "now,\" ejaculated the Long Island sailor.  Going to his vice-bench, the\n"
 "carpenter for convenience' sake and general reference, now\n"
 "transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin was to be,\n"
 "and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at its\n"
 "extremities. This done, he marshalled the planks and his tools, and to\n"
 "work.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and\n"
 "fitted, he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it,\n"
 "inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direction.\n"
 "Overhearing the indignant but half- humorous cries with which the\n"
 "people on deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every\n"
 "one's consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly\n"
 "brought to him, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all\n"
 "mortals, some dying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since\n"
 "they will shortly trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows\n"
 "ought to be indulged.  Leaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long\n"
 "regarded the coffin with an attentive eye. He then called for his\n"
 "harpoon, had the wooden stock drawn from it, and then had the iron\n"
 "part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his\n"
 "boat. All by his own request, also, biscuits were then ranged round\n"
 "the sides within: a flask of fresh water was placed at the head, and a\n"
 "small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot; and a\n"
 "piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for a pillow, Queequeg now\n"
 "entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that he might make trial of\n"
 "its comforts, if any it had. He lay without moving a few minutes, then\n"
 "told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god, Yojo. Then\n"
 "crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo between, he called for the\n"
 "coffin lid (hatch he called it) to be placed over him. The head part\n"
 "turned over with a leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg in his coffin\n"
 "with little but his composed countenance in view. Rarmai (it will do;\n"
 "it is easy), he murmured at last, and signed to be replaced in his\n"
 "hammock.  But ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near\n"
 "by all this while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft\n"
 "sobbings, took him by the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.\n"
 "\"Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving? Where\n"
 "go ye now? But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where\n"
 "the beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye do one little\n"
 "errand for me? Seek out one Pip, who's now been missing long: I think\n"
 "he's in those far Antilles. If ye find him, then comfort him; for he\n"
 "must be very sad; for look!\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " he's left his tambourine behind; - I found it. Rig-a-dig,\n"
 "dig, dig! Now, Queequeg, die; and I'll beat ye your dying march.\"  \"I\n"
 "have heard,\" murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, \"that in\n"
 "violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues;\n"
 "and that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in their\n"
 "wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really\n"
 "spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars. So, to my fond faith,\n"
 "poor Pip, in this strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings heavenly\n"
 "vouchers of all our heavenly homes. Where learned he that, but there?\n"
 "- Hark! he speaks again: but more wildly now.\"  \"From two and two!\n"
 "Let's make a General of him! Ho, where's his harpoon? Lay it across\n"
 "here. - Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza! Oh for a game cock now to sit upon\n"
 "his head and crow! Queequeg dies game! - mind ye that; Queequeg dies\n"
 "game! - take ye good heed of that; Queequeg dies game! I say; game,\n"
 "game, game! but base little Pip, he died a coward; died all a'shiver;\n"
 "- out upon Pip! Hark ye; if ye find Pip, tell all the Antilles he's a\n"
 "runaway; a coward, a coward, a coward!  Tell them he jumped from a\n"
 "whale-boat! I'd never beat my tambourine over base Pip, and hail him\n"
 "General, if he were once more dying here. No, no! shame upon all\n"
 "cowards - shame upon them! Let 'em go drown like Pip, that jumped from\n"
 "a whale-boat. Shame! shame!\"  During all this, Queequeg lay with\n"
 "closed eyes, as if in a dream. Pip was led away, and the sick man was\n"
 "replaced in his hammock.  But now that he had apparently made every\n"
 "preparation for death; now that his coffin was proved a good fit,\n"
 "Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon there seemed no need of the\n"
 "carpenter's box: and thereupon, when some expressed their delighted\n"
 "surprise, he, in substance, said, that the cause of his sudden\n"
 "convalescence was this; - at a critical moment, he had just recalled a\n"
 "little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone; and therefore had\n"
 "changed his mind about dying: he could not die yet, he averred. They\n"
 "asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter of his own\n"
 "sovereign will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a word, it was\n"
 "Queequeg's conceit, that if a man\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not kill him:\n"
 "nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable,\n"
 "unintelligent destroyer of that sort.  Now, there is this noteworthy\n"
 "difference between savage and civilized; that while a sick, civilized\n"
 "man may be six months convalescing, generally speaking, a sick savage\n"
 "is almost half-well again in a day. So, in good time my Queequeg\n"
 "gained strength; and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few\n"
 "indolent days (but eating with a vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped\n"
 "to his feet, threw out arms and legs, gave himself a good stretching,\n"
 "yawned a little bit, and then springing into the head of his hoisted\n"
 "boat, and poising a harpoon, pronounced himself fit for a fight.  With\n"
 "a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea- chest; and\n"
 "emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order\n"
 "there. Many spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner\n"
 "of grotesque figures and drawings; and it seemed that hereby he was\n"
 "striving, in his rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on\n"
 "his body. And this tattooing, had been the work of a departed prophet\n"
 "and seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written\n"
 "out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a\n"
 "mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that Queequeg in\n"
 "his own proper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous work in one\n"
 "volume; but whose mysteries not even himself could read, though his\n"
 "own live heart beat against them; and these mysteries were therefore\n"
 "destined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon\n"
 "they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the last. And this thought\n"
 "it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of\n"
 "his, when one morning turning away from surveying poor Queequeg - \"Oh,\n"
 "devilish tantalization of the gods!\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the\n"
 "great South Sea; were it not for other things, I could have greeted my\n"
 "dear Pacific with uncounted thanks, for now the long supplication of\n"
 "my youth was answered; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a\n"
 "thousand leagues of blue.  There is, one knows not what sweet mystery\n"
 "about this sea, whose gently awful stirrings seem to speak of some\n"
 "hidden soul beneath; like those fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod\n"
 "over the buried Evangelist St. John. And meet it is, that over these\n"
 "sea- pastures, wide-rolling watery prairies and Potters' Fields of all\n"
 "four continents, the waves should rise and fall, and ebb and flow\n"
 "unceasingly; for here, millions of mixed shades and shadows, drowned\n"
 "dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all that we call lives and souls, lie\n"
 "dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing like slumberers in their beds; the\n"
 "ever-rolling waves but made so by their restlessness.  To any\n"
 "meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld, must ever\n"
 "after be the sea of his adoption. It rolls the midmost waters of the\n"
 "world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms. The same\n"
 "waves wash the moles of the new-built Californian towns, but yesterday\n"
 "planted by the recentest race of men, and lave the faded but still\n"
 "gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands, older than Abraham; while all\n"
 "between float milky-ways of coral isles, and low-lying, endless,\n"
 "unknown Archipelagoes, and impenetrable Japans. Thus this mysterious,\n"
 "divine Pacific zones the world's whole bulk about; makes all coasts\n"
 "one bay to it; seems the tide-beating heart of earth. Lifted by those\n"
 "eternal swells, you needs must own the seductive god, bowing your head\n"
 "to Pan.  But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab's brain, as standing\n"
 "like an iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " rigging, with one nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary\n"
 "musk from the Bashee isles (in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be\n"
 "walking), and with the other consciously inhaled the salt breath of\n"
 "the new found sea; that sea in which the hated White Whale must even\n"
 "then be swimming. Launched at length upon these almost final waters,\n"
 "and gliding towards the Japanese cruising-ground, the old man's\n"
 "purpose intensified itself. His firm lips met like the lips of a vice;\n"
 "the Delta of his forehead's veins swelled like overladen brooks; in\n"
 "his very sleep, his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull, Stern\n"
 "all! the White Whale spouts thick blood!\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Availing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now\n"
 "reigned in these latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly\n"
 "active pursuits shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed,\n"
 "blistered old blacksmith, had not removed his portable forge to the\n"
 "hold again, after concluding his contributory work for Ahab's leg, but\n"
 "still retained it on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast;\n"
 "being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers,\n"
 "and bowsmen to do some little job for them; altering, or repairing, or\n"
 "new shaping their various weapons and boat furniture. Often he would\n"
 "be surrounded by an eager circle, all waiting to be served; holding\n"
 "boat-spades, pike- heads, harpoons, and lances, and jealously watching\n"
 "his every sooty movement, as he toiled. Nevertheless, this old man's\n"
 "was a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm. No murmur, no\n"
 "impatience, no petulence did come from him. Silent, slow, and solemn;\n"
 "bowing over still further his chronically broken back, he toiled away,\n"
 "as if toil were life itself, and the heavy beating of his hammer the\n"
 "heavy beating of his heart. And so it was. - Most miserable!\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " A peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful\n"
 "appearing yawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage\n"
 "excited the curiosity of the mariners. And to the importunity of their\n"
 "persisted questionings he had finally given in; and so it came to pass\n"
 "that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate.\n"
 "Belated, and not innocently, one bitter winter's midnight, on the road\n"
 "running between two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly felt\n"
 "the deadly numbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a leaning,\n"
 "dilapidated barn. The issue was, the loss of the extremities of both\n"
 "feet. Out of this revelation, part by part, at last came out the four\n"
 "acts of the gladness, and the one long, and as yet uncatastrophied\n"
 "fifth act of the grief of his life's drama.  He was an old man, who,\n"
 "at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly encountered that thing in\n"
 "sorrow's technicals called ruin. He had been an artisan of famed\n"
 "excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a house and garden; embraced\n"
 "a youthful, daughter-like, loving wife, and three blithe, ruddy\n"
 "children; every Sunday went to a cheerful-looking church, planted in a\n"
 "grove. But one night, under cover of darkness, and further concealed\n"
 "in a most cunning disguisement, a desperate burglar slid into his\n"
 "happy home, and robbed them all of everything.  And darker yet to\n"
 "tell, the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into\n"
 "his family's heart. It was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon the opening of\n"
 "that fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his\n"
 "home. Now, for prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the\n"
 "blacksmith's shop was in the basement of his dwelling, but with a\n"
 "separate entrance to it; so that always had the young and loving\n"
 "healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness, but with vigorous\n"
 "pleasure, to the stout ringing of her young-armed old husband's\n"
 "hammer; whose reverberations, muffled by passing through the floors\n"
 "and walls, came up to her, not unsweetly, in her nursery; and so, to\n"
 "stout Labor's iron lullaby, the blacksmith's infants were rocked to\n"
 "slumber.  Oh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be\n"
 "timely? Hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full\n"
 "ruin came upon him, then had the young widow had a\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " delicious grief, and her orphans a truly venerable, legendary\n"
 "sire to dream of in their after years; and all of them a care-killing\n"
 "competency. But Death plucked down some virtuous elder brother, on\n"
 "whose whistling daily toil solely hung the responsibilities of some\n"
 "other family, and left the worse than useless old man standing, till\n"
 "the hideous rot of life should make him easier to harvest.  Why tell\n"
 "the whole? The blows of the basement hammer every day grew more and\n"
 "more between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the last; the\n"
 "wife sat frozen at the window, with tearless eyes, glitteringly gazing\n"
 "into the weeping faces of her children; the bellows fell; the forge\n"
 "choked up with cinders; the house was sold; the mother dived down into\n"
 "the long church-yard grass; her children twice followed her thither;\n"
 "and the houseless, familyless old man staggered off a vagabond in\n"
 "crape; his every woe unreverenced; his grey head a scorn to flaxen\n"
 "curls!  Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this;\n"
 "but Death is only a launching into the region of the strange Untried;\n"
 "it is but the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense\n"
 "Remote, the Wild, the Watery, the Unshored; therefore, to the\n"
 "death-longing eyes of such men, who still have left in them some\n"
 "interior compunctions against suicide, does the all-contributed and\n"
 "all- receptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain of\n"
 "unimaginable, taking terrors, and wonderful, new-life adventures; and\n"
 "from the hearts of infinite Pacifics, the thousand mermaids sing to\n"
 "them - Come hither, broken-hearted; here is another life without the\n"
 "guilt of intermediate death; here are wonders supernatural, without\n"
 "dying for them. Come hither! bury thyself in a life which, to your now\n"
 "equally abhorred and abhorring, landed world, is more oblivious than\n"
 "death. Come hither! put up thy grave-stone, too, within the\n"
 "churchyard, and come hither, till we marry thee!  Hearkening to these\n"
 "voices, East and West, by early sun-rise, and by fall of eve, the\n"
 "blacksmith's soul responded, Aye, I come! And so Perth went a-whaling.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " With matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark- skin\n"
 "apron, about mid-day, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil,\n"
 "the latter placed upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a\n"
 "pike-head in the coals, and with the other at his forge's lungs, when\n"
 "captain Ahab came along, carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking\n"
 "leathern bag. While yet a little distance from the forge, moody Ahab\n"
 "paused; till at last, Perth, withdrawing his iron from the fire, began\n"
 "hammering it upon the anvil - the red mass sending off the sparks in\n"
 "thick hovering flights, some of which flew close to Ahab.  \"Are these\n"
 "thy Mother Carey's chickens, Perth? they are always flying in thy\n"
 "wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all; - look here, they burn;\n"
 "but thou - thou liv'st among them without a scorch.\"  \"Because I am\n"
 "scorched all over, Captain Ahab, answered Perth, resting for a moment\n"
 "on his hammer; I am past scorching; not easily can'st thou scorch a\n"
 "scar.\"  \"Well, well; no more. Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly,\n"
 "sanely woful to me. In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all\n"
 "misery in others that is not mad. Thou should'st go mad, blacksmith;\n"
 "say, why dost thou not go mad? How can'st thou endure without being\n"
 "mad? Do the heavens yet hate thee, that thou can'st not go mad? - What\n"
 "wert thou making there?\"  \"Welding an old pike-head, Sir; there were\n"
 "seams and dents in it.\"  \"And can'st thou make it all smooth, again,\n"
 "blacksmith, after such hard usage as it had?\"  \"I think so, Sir.\"\n"
 "\"And I suppose thou can'st smoothe almost any seams and dents; never\n"
 "mind how hard the metal, blacksmith?\"  \"Aye, Sir, I think I can; all\n"
 "seams and dents but one.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"Look ye here, then,\" cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and\n"
 "leaning with both hands on Perth's shoulders; \"look ye here - here -\n"
 "can ye smoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith\", sweeping one hand\n"
 "across his ribbed brows; \"if thou could'st, blacksmith, glad enough\n"
 "would I lay my head upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer\n"
 "between my eyes. Answer! Can'st thou smoothe this seam?\"  \"Oh! that is\n"
 "the one, Sir! Said I not all seams and dents but one?\"  \"Aye,\n"
 "blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for though\n"
 "thou only see'st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into the bone\n"
 "of my skull - that is all wrinkles! But, away with child's play; no\n"
 "more gaffs and pikes to-day. Look ye here!\" jingling the leathern bag,\n"
 "as if it were full of gold coins. \"I, too, want a harpoon made; one\n"
 "that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part, Perth; something that\n"
 "will stick in a whale like his own fin-bone.  There's the stuff,\n"
 "flinging the pouch upon the anvil. Look ye, blacksmith, these are the\n"
 "gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses.\"\n"
 "\"Horse-shoe stubbs, Sir? Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then, the\n"
 "best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work.\"  \"I know it, old\n"
 "man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the melted bones\n"
 "of murderers. Quick! forge me the harpoon. And forge me first, twelve\n"
 "rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer these twelve\n"
 "together like the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick! I'll blow\n"
 "the fire.\"  When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them,\n"
 "one by one, by spiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy\n"
 "iron bolt. \"A flaw!  rejecting the last one. Work that over again,\n"
 "Perth.\"  This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into\n"
 "one, when Ahab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own\n"
 "iron. As, then, with regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil,\n"
 "Perth passing to him the glowing rods, one after the other, and the\n"
 "hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee\n"
 "passed silently, and bowing over his head towards the fire, seemed\n"
 "invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil. But, as Ahab looked\n"
 "up, he slid aside.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"What's that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?\"\n"
 "muttered Stubb, looking on from the forecastle. \"That Parsee smells\n"
 "fire like a fusee; and smells of it himself, like a hot musket's\n"
 "powder-pan.\"  At last the shank, in one complete rod, received its\n"
 "final heat; and as perth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into\n"
 "the cask of water near by, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab's bent\n"
 "face.  \"Would'st thou brand me, Perth?\" wincing for a moment with the\n"
 "pain; \"have I been but forging my own branding-iron, then?\"  \"Pray\n"
 "God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab. Is not this harpoon\n"
 "for the White Whale?\"  \"For the white fiend! But now for the barbs;\n"
 "thou must make them thyself, man.  Here are my razors - the best of\n"
 "steel; here, and make the barbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy\n"
 "Sea.\"  For a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he\n"
 "would fain not use them.  \"Take them, man, I have no need for them;\n"
 "for I now neither shave, sup, nor pray till - but here - to work!\"\n"
 "Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the\n"
 "shank, the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the\n"
 "blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to\n"
 "tempering them, he cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near.  \"No,\n"
 "no - no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper. Ahoy,\n"
 "there!  Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give\n"
 "me as much blood as will cover this barb?\" holding it high up. A\n"
 "cluster of dark nods replied, Yes. Three punctures were made in the\n"
 "heathen flesh, and the White Whale's barbs were then tempered.  \"Ego\n"
 "non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!\" deliriously\n"
 "howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal\n"
 "blood.  Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one\n"
 "of hickory, with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to\n"
 "the socket of the iron. A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and\n"
 "some fathoms of it taken to the windlass, and\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " stretched to a great tension. Pressing his foot upon it, till\n"
 "the rope hummed like a harp-string, then eagerly bending over it, and\n"
 "seeing no strandings, Ahab exclaimed, \"Good! and now for the\n"
 "seizings.\"  At one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate\n"
 "spread yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the\n"
 "harpoon; the pole was then driven hard up into the socket; from the\n"
 "lower end the rope was traced half way along the pole's length, and\n"
 "firmly secured so, with intertwistings of twine. This done, pole,\n"
 "iron, and rope - like the Three Fates - remained inseparable, and Ahab\n"
 "moodily stalked away with the weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and\n"
 "the sound of the hickory pole, both hollowly ringing along every\n"
 "plank. But ere he entered his cabin, a light, unnatural,\n"
 "half-bantering, yet most piteous sound was heard.  Oh, Pip! thy\n"
 "wretched laugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy strange mummeries\n"
 "not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship,\n"
 "and mocked it!\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Penetrating further and further into the heart of the\n"
 "Japanese cruising ground, the Pequod was soon all astir in the\n"
 "fishery. Often, in mild, pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen,\n"
 "eighteen, and twenty hours on the stretch, they were engaged in the\n"
 "boats, steadily pulling, or sailing, or paddling after the whales, or\n"
 "for an interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their\n"
 "uprising; though with but small success for their pains.  At such\n"
 "times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow heaving\n"
 "swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and so sociably\n"
 "mixing with the soft waves themselves, that like hearth-stone cats\n"
 "they purr against the gunwale; these are the times of dreamy quietude,\n"
 "when beholding the tranquil\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " beauty and brilliancy of the ocean's skin, one forgets the\n"
 "tiger heart that pants beneath it; and would not willingly remember,\n"
 "that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang.  These are the\n"
 "times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a certain filial,\n"
 "confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he regards it as so\n"
 "much flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing only the tops of\n"
 "her masts, seems struggling forward, not though high rolling waves,\n"
 "but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie: as when the western\n"
 "emigrants' horses only show their erected ears, while their hidden\n"
 "bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure.  The long-drawn virgin\n"
 "vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these there steals the hush,\n"
 "the hum; you almost swear that play-wearied children lie sleeping in\n"
 "these solitudes, in some glad May-time, when the flowers of the woods\n"
 "are plucked. And all this mixes with your most mystic mood; so that\n"
 "fact and fancy, half-way meeting, interpenetrate, and form one\n"
 "seamless whole.  Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail\n"
 "of at least as temporary an effect on Ahab. But if these secret golden\n"
 "keys did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did\n"
 "his breath upon them prove but tarnishing.\n"
 "\n"
 "Oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in\n"
 "ye, - though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life, - in\n"
 "ye, men yet may roll, like young horses in new morning clover; and for\n"
 "some few fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the life immortal on\n"
 "them. Would to God these blessed calms would last. But the mingled,\n"
 "mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof: calms crossed by\n"
 "storms, a storm for every calm. There is no steady unretracing\n"
 "progress in this life; we do not advance through fixed gradations, and\n"
 "at the last one pause: - through infancy's unconscious spell,\n"
 "boyhood's thoughtless faith, adolescence' doubt (the common doom),\n"
 "then scepticism, then disbelief, resting at last in manhood's\n"
 "pondering repose of If.  But once gone through, we trace the round\n"
 "again; and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs eternally. Where lies\n"
 "the final harbor, whence we unmoor no more? in what rapt ether sails\n"
 "the world, of which the weariest will\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " never weary? Where is the foundling's father hidden? Our\n"
 "souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing\n"
 "them: the secret of our paternity lies in their grave, and we must\n"
 "there to learn it.  And that same day, too, gazing far down from his\n"
 "boat's side into that same golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured: -\n"
 "\"Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride's eye!\n"
 "- Tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping cannibal\n"
 "ways. Let faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look deep down and\n"
 "do believe.\"  And Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up\n"
 "in that same golden light: - \"I am Stubb, and Stubb has his history;\n"
 "but here Stubb takes oaths that he has always been jolly!\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came\n"
 "bearing down before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab's harpoon had\n"
 "been welded.  It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just\n"
 "wedged in her last cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches;\n"
 "and now, in glad holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat\n"
 "vain-gloriously, sailing round among the widely-separated ships on the\n"
 "ground, previous to pointing her prow for home.  The three men at her\n"
 "mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at their hats;\n"
 "from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended, bottom down; and hanging\n"
 "captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last\n"
 "whale they had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks of all colors were\n"
 "flying from her rigging, on every side. Sideways lashed in each of her\n"
 "three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm; above which, in her\n"
 "top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a\n"
 "brazen lamp.  As was afterwards learned, the bachelor had met with the\n"
 "most surprising success; all the more wonderful, for that while\n"
 "cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire\n"
 "months without securing a single fish.  Not only had barrels of beef\n"
 "and bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable\n"
 "sperm, but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for, from\n"
 "the ships she had met; and these were stowed along the deck, and in\n"
 "the captain's and officers' staterooms. Even the cabin table itself\n"
 "had been knocked into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the\n"
 "broad head of an oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a\n"
 "centrepiece. In the forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked and\n"
 "pitched their chests, and filled them; it was humorously added, that\n"
 "the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and filled it; that\n"
 "the steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled it; that the\n"
 "harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them;\n"
 "that indeed everything was filled with sperm, except the captain's\n"
 "pantaloons pockets, and those he reserved to thrust his hands into, in\n"
 "self- complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction.  As this glad\n"
 "ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the barbarian sound\n"
 "of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and drawing still nearer,\n"
 "a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge try-pots, which,\n"
 "covered with the parchment-like poke or stomach skin of the black\n"
 "fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of\n"
 "the crew. On the quarter-deck, the mates and harpooneers were dancing\n"
 "with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with them from the Polynesian\n"
 "Isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat, firmly secured aloft\n"
 "between the foremast and mainmast, three Long Island negroes, with\n"
 "glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were presiding over the\n"
 "hilarious jig.  Meanwhile, others of the ship's company were\n"
 "tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try-works, from which the huge\n"
 "pots had been removed. You would have almost thought they were pulling\n"
 "down the cursed Bastile, such wild cries they raised, as the now\n"
 "useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Lord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect\n"
 "on the ship's elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama\n"
 "was full before him, and seemed merely contrived for his own\n"
 "individual diversion.  And Ahab, he too was standing on his\n"
 "quarter-deck, shaggy and black, with a stubborn gloom; and as the two\n"
 "ships crossed each other's wakes - one all jubilations for things\n"
 "passed, the other all forebodings as to things to come - their two\n"
 "captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the\n"
 "scene.  \"Come aboard, come aboard!\" cried the gay Bachelor's\n"
 "commander, lifting a glass and a bottle in the air.  \"Hast seen the\n"
 "White Whale?\" gritted Ahab in reply.  \"No; only heard of him; but\n"
 "don't believe in him at all,\" said the other good-humoredly. \"Come\n"
 "aboard!\"  \"Thou are too damned jolly. Sail on. Hast lost any men?\"  \"\n"
 "Not enough to speak of - two islanders, that's all; - but come aboard,\n"
 "old hearty, come along. I'll soon take that black from your brow. Come\n"
 "along, will ye (merry's the play); a full ship and homeward-bound.\"\n"
 "\"How wondrous familiar is a fool!\" muttered Ahab; then aloud, \"Thou\n"
 "art a full ship and homeward bound, thou sayest; well, then, call me\n"
 "an empty ship, and outward-bound. So go thy ways, and I will\n"
 "mine. Forward there! Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!\"  And\n"
 "thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the other\n"
 "stubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted; the crew\n"
 "of the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the\n"
 "receding Bachelor; but the Bachelor's men never heeding their gaze for\n"
 "the lively revelry they were in.  And as Ahab, leaning over the\n"
 "taffrail, eyed the homeward-bound craft, he took from his pocket a\n"
 "small vial of sand, and then looking from the ship to the vial, seemed\n"
 "thereby bringing two remote associations together, for that vial was\n"
 "filled with Nantucket soundings.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune's\n"
 "favorites sail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch\n"
 "somewhat of the rushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails\n"
 "fill out. So seemed it with the Pequod. For next day after\n"
 "encountering the gay Bachelor, whales were seen and four were slain;\n"
 "and one of them by Ahab.  It was far down the afternoon; and when all\n"
 "the spearings of the crimson fight were done: and floating in the\n"
 "lovely sunset sea and sky, sun and whale both stilly died together;\n"
 "then, such a sweetness and such plaintiveness, such inwreathing\n"
 "orisons curled up in that rosy air, that it almost seemed as if far\n"
 "over from the deep green convent valleys of the Manilla isles, the\n"
 "Spanish land- breeze, wantonly turned sailor, had gone to sea,\n"
 "freighted with these vesper hymns.  Soothed again, but only soothed to\n"
 "deeper gloom, Ahab, who had sterned off from the whale, sat intently\n"
 "watching his final wanings from the now tranquil boat.  For that\n"
 "strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales dying - the turning\n"
 "sunwards of the head, and so expiring - that strange spectacle, beheld\n"
 "of such a placid evening, somehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrousness\n"
 "unknown before.  \"He turns and turns him to it, - how slowly, but how\n"
 "steadfastly, his homage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last\n"
 "dying motions. He too worships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial\n"
 "vassal of the sun! - Oh that these too-favoring eyes should see these\n"
 "too-favoring sights. Look! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of\n"
 "human weal or woe; in these most candid and impartial seas; where to\n"
 "traditions no rocks furnish tablets; where for long Chinese ages, the\n"
 "billows have still rolled on speechless and unspoken to, as stars that\n"
 "shine upon the Niger's unknown source; here, too, life dies sunwards\n"
 "full of\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " faith; but see! no sooner dead, than death whirls round the\n"
 "corpse, and it heads some other way. - \"Oh, thou dark Hindoo half of\n"
 "nature, who of drowned bones hast builded thy separate throne\n"
 "somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas; thou art an infidel,\n"
 "thou queen, and too truly speakest to me in the wide-slaughtering\n"
 "Typhoon, and the hushed burial of its after calm. Nor has this thy\n"
 "whale sunwards turned his dying head, and then gone round again,\n"
 "without a lesson to me.  \"Oh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power!\n"
 "Oh, high aspiring, rainbowed jet! - that one strivest, this one\n"
 "jettest all in vain! In vain, oh whale, dost thou seek intercedings\n"
 "with yon all-quickening sun, that only calls forth life, but gives it\n"
 "not again. Yet dost thou, darker half, rock me with a prouder, if a\n"
 "darker faith. All thy unnamable imminglings, float beneath me here; I\n"
 "am buoyed by breaths of once living things, exhaled as air, but water\n"
 "now.  \"Then hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the\n"
 "wild fowl finds his only rest. Born of earth, yet suckled by the sea;\n"
 "though hill and valley mothered me, ye billows are my\n"
 "foster-brothers!\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one,\n"
 "far to windward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one\n"
 "astern. These last three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the\n"
 "windward one could not be reached till morning; and the boat that had\n"
 "killed it lay by its side all night; and that boat was Ahab's.  The\n"
 "waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale's spout-hole; and the\n"
 "lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare upon\n"
 "the black, glossy back, and far out upon the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " midnight waves, which gently chafed the whale's broad flank,\n"
 "like soft surf upon a beach.  Ahab and all his boat's crew seemed\n"
 "asleep but the Parsee; who crouching in the bow, sat watching the\n"
 "sharks, that spectrally played round the whale, and tapped the light\n"
 "cedar planks with their tails. A sound like the moaning in squadrons\n"
 "over Asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering\n"
 "through the air.  Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw\n"
 "the Parsee; and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the\n"
 "last men in a flooded world. \"I have dreamed it again,\" said he.  \"Of\n"
 "the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor coffin\n"
 "can be thine?\"  \"And who are hearsed that die on the sea?\"  \"But I\n"
 "said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two hearses\n"
 "must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by mortal\n"
 "hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in America.\"\n"
 "\"Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee: - a hearse and its plumes\n"
 "floating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers. Ha! Such\n"
 "a sight we shall not soon see.\"  \"Believe it or not, thou canst not\n"
 "die till it be seen, old man.\"  \"And what was that saying about\n"
 "thyself?\"  \"Though it come to the last, I shall still go before thee\n"
 "thy pilot.\"  \"And when thou art so gone before - if that ever befall -\n"
 "then ere I can follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me\n"
 "still? - Was it not so? Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my\n"
 "pilot! I have here two pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and\n"
 "survive it.\"  \"Take another pledge, old man, said the Parsee, as his\n"
 "eyes lighted up like fire-flies in the gloom, - Hemp only can kill\n"
 "thee.\"  \"The gallows, ye mean. - I am immortal then, on land and on\n"
 "sea,\" cried Ahab, with a laugh of derision; - \"Immortal on land and on\n"
 "sea!\"  Both were silent again, as one man. The grey dawn came on, and\n"
 "the slumbering crew arose from the boat's bottom, and ere noon the\n"
 "dead whale was brought to the ship.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " The season for the Line at length drew near; and every day\n"
 "when Ahab, coming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant\n"
 "helmsman would ostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager\n"
 "mariners quickly run to the braces, and would stand there with all\n"
 "their eyes centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon; impatient for the\n"
 "order to point the ship's prow for the equator. In good time the order\n"
 "came. It was hard upon high noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his\n"
 "high-hoisted boat, was about taking his wonted daily obervation of the\n"
 "sun to determine his latitude.  Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in\n"
 "summer are as freshets of effulgences.  That unblinkingly vivid\n"
 "Japanese sun seems the blazing focus of the glassy ocean's\n"
 "immeasureable burning-glass. The sky looks lacquered; clouds there are\n"
 "none; the horizon floats; and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance is\n"
 "as the insufferable splendors of God's throne. Well that Ahab's\n"
 "quadrant was furnished with colored glasses, through which to take\n"
 "sight of that solar fire. So, swinging his seated form to the roll of\n"
 "the ship, and with his astrological-looking instrument placed to his\n"
 "eye, he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise\n"
 "instant when the sun should gain its precise meridian. Meantime while\n"
 "his whole attention was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him\n"
 "on the ship's deck, and with face thrown up like Ahab's, was eyeing\n"
 "the same sun with him; only the lids of his eyes half hooded their\n"
 "orbs, and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness. At\n"
 "length the desired observation was taken; and with his pencil upon his\n"
 "ivory leg, Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that\n"
 "precise instant.  Then falling into a moment's revery, he again looked\n"
 "up towards the sun and murmured to himself: \"Thou sea-mark! thou high\n"
 "and mighty Pilot! thou tellest me truly\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " where I am - but canst thou cast the least hint where I shall\n"
 "be? Or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this\n"
 "moment living? Where is Moby Dick? This instant thou must be eyeing\n"
 "him. These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now\n"
 "beholding him; aye, and into the eye that is even now equally\n"
 "beholding the objects on the unknown, thither side of thee, thou sun!\"\n"
 "Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its\n"
 "numerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered:\n"
 "\"Foolish toy!  babies' plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores,\n"
 "and Captains; the world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but\n"
 "what after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where\n"
 "thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that\n"
 "holds thee: no! not one jot more! Thou canst not tell where one drop\n"
 "of water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with thy\n"
 "impotence thou insultest the sun! Science! Curse thee, thou vain toy;\n"
 "and cursed be all the things that cast man's eyes aloft to that\n"
 "heaven, whose live vividness but scorches him, as these old eyes are\n"
 "even now scorched with thy light, O sun! Level by nature to this\n"
 "earth's horizon are the glances of man's eyes; not shot from the crown\n"
 "of his head, as if God had meant him to gaze on his firmament. Curse\n"
 "thee, thou quadrant!\" dashing it to the deck, \"no longer will I guide\n"
 "my earthly way by thee; the level ship's compass, and the level\n"
 "dead-reckoning, by log and by line; these shall conduct me, and show\n"
 "me my place on the sea. Aye,\" lighting from the boat to the deck,\n"
 "\"thus I trample on thee, thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on\n"
 "high; thus I split and destroy thee!\"  As the frantic old man thus\n"
 "spoke and thus trampled with his live and dead feet, a sneering\n"
 "triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a fatalistic despair that\n"
 "seemed meant for himself - these passed over the mute, motionless\n"
 "Parsee's face.  Unobserved he rose and glided away; while, awestruck\n"
 "by the aspect of their commander, the seamen clustered together on the\n"
 "forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing the deck, shouted out - \"To\n"
 "the braces! Up helm! - square in!\"\n"
 "\n"
 "In an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " upon her heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly\n"
 "poised upon her long, ribbed hull, seemed as the three Horatii\n"
 "pirouetting on one sufficient steed.  Standing between the\n"
 "knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod's tumultuous way, and Ahab's\n"
 "also, as he went lurching along the deck.  \"I have sat before the\n"
 "dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full of its tormented\n"
 "flaming life; and I have seen it wane at last, down, down, to dumbest\n"
 "dust. Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of thine, what will at\n"
 "length remain but one little heap of ashes!\"  \"Aye,\" cried Stubb, \"but\n"
 "sea-coal ashes - mind ye that, Mr. Starbuck - sea- coal, not your\n"
 "common charcoal. Well, well; I heard Ahab mutter, \"Here some one\n"
 "thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine; swears that I must\n"
 "play them, and no others.\" And damn me, Ahab, but thou actest right;\n"
 "live in the game, and die it!\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of\n"
 "Bengal crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure. Skies the most\n"
 "effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows\n"
 "tornadoes that never swept tame northern lands. So, too, it is, that\n"
 "in these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst\n"
 "of all storms, the Typhoon. It will sometimes burst from out that\n"
 "cloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.\n"
 "Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and\n"
 "bare- poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly\n"
 "ahead. When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the\n"
 "thunder, and blazed with the lightning, that showed the disabled masts\n"
 "fluttering here and there with\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the rags which the first fury of the tempest had left for its\n"
 "after sport.  Holding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the\n"
 "quarter-deck; at every flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see\n"
 "what additional disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper\n"
 "there; while Stubb and Flask were directing the men in the higher\n"
 "hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats. But all their pains seemed\n"
 "naught. Though lifted to the very top of the cranes, the windward\n"
 "quarter boat (Ahab's) did not escape. A great rolling sea, dashing\n"
 "high up against the reeling ship's high tetering side, stove in the\n"
 "boat's bottom at the stern, and left it again, all dripping through\n"
 "like a sieve.  \"Bad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck,\" said Stubb,\n"
 "regarding the wreck, \"but the sea will have its way. Stubb, for one,\n"
 "can't fight it. You see, Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long\n"
 "start before it leaps, all round the world it runs, and then comes the\n"
 "spring! But as for me, all the start I have to meet it, is just across\n"
 "the deck here. But never mind; it's all in fun: so the old song says;\"\n"
 "- (sings). Oh! jolly is the gale, And a joker is the whale, A'\n"
 "flourishin' his tail, - Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky,\n"
 "hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh! The scud all a flyin', That's his\n"
 "flip only foamin'; When he stirs in the spicin', - Such a funny,\n"
 "sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh! Thunder\n"
 "splits the ships, But he only smacks his lips, A tastin' of this flip,\n"
 "- Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the\n"
 "Ocean, oh!  \"Avast Stubb,\" cried Starbuck, \"let the Typhoon sing, and\n"
 "strike his harp here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou\n"
 "wilt hold thy peace.\"  \"But I am not a brave man; never said i was a\n"
 "brave man; I am a coward; and I sing to keep up my spirits. And I tell\n"
 "you what it is, Mr. Starbuck, there's no way to stop my singing\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " in this world but to cut my throat. And when that's done, ten\n"
 "to one I sing ye the doxology for a wind-up.\"  \"Madman! look through\n"
 "my eyes if thou hast none of thine own.\"  \"What! how can you see\n"
 "better of a dark night than anybody else, never mind how foolish?\"\n"
 "\"Here!\" cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing\n"
 "his hand towards the weather bow, \"markest thou not that the gale\n"
 "comes from the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick?\n"
 "the very course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there;\n"
 "where is that stove? In the stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to\n"
 "stand - his stand-point is stove, man!  Now jump overboard, and sing\n"
 "away, if thou must!\"  \"I don't half understand ye: what's in the\n"
 "wind?\"  \"Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to\n"
 "Nantucket,\" soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb's\n"
 "question. \"The gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it\n"
 "into a fair wind that will drive us towards home. Yonder, to windward,\n"
 "all is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward - I see it lightens\n"
 "up there; but not with the lightning.\"  At that moment in one of the\n"
 "intervals of profound darkness, following the flashes, a voice was\n"
 "heard at his side; and almost at the same instant a volley of thunder\n"
 "peals rolled overhead.  \"Who's there?\"  \"Old Thunder!\" said Ahab,\n"
 "groping his way along the bulwarks to his pivot-hole; but suddenly\n"
 "finding his path made plain to him by elbowed lances of fire.  Now, as\n"
 "the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the\n"
 "perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some\n"
 "ships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the\n"
 "water. But as this conductor must descend to considerable depth, that\n"
 "its end may avoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept\n"
 "constantly towing there, it would be liable to many mishaps, besides\n"
 "interfering not a little with some of the rigging, and more or less\n"
 "impeding the vessel's way in the water; because of all this, the lower\n"
 "parts of a ship's\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are generally\n"
 "made in long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up\n"
 "into the chains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may\n"
 "require.  \"The rods! the rods!\" cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly\n"
 "admonished to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been\n"
 "darting flambeaux, to light Ahab to his post. \"Are they overboard?\n"
 "drop them over, fore and aft. Quick!\"  \"Avast!\" cried Ahab; \"let's\n"
 "have fair play here, though we be the weaker side.  Yet I'll\n"
 "contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and Andes, that all the\n"
 "world may be secured; but out on privileges! Let them be, Sir.\"  \"Look\n"
 "aloft!\" cried Starbuck. \"The St. Elmo's Lights(corpus sancti)\n"
 "corpusants!  the corpusants!\"  All the yard-arms were tipped with a\n"
 "pallid fire; and touched at each tri-pointed lightning-rod-end with\n"
 "three tapering white flames, each of the three tall masts was silently\n"
 "burning in that sulphurous air, like three gigantic wax tapers before\n"
 "an altar.  \"Blast the boat! let it go!\" cried Stubb at this instant,\n"
 "as a swashing sea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its\n"
 "gunwale violently jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing. \"Blast\n"
 "it!\" - but slipping backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes caught the\n"
 "flames; and immediately shifting his tone, he cried - \"The corpusants\n"
 "have mercy on us all!\"  To sailors, oaths are household words; they\n"
 "will swear in the trance of the calm, and in the teeth of the tempest;\n"
 "they will imprecate curses from the topsail-yard-arms, when most they\n"
 "teter over to a seething sea; but in all my voyagings, seldom have I\n"
 "heard a common oath when God's burning finger has been laid on the\n"
 "ship; when his \"Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin\" has been woven into the\n"
 "shrouds and the cordage.  While this pallidness was burning aloft, few\n"
 "words were heard from the enchanted crew; who in one thick cluster\n"
 "stood on the forecastle, all their eyes gleaming in that pale\n"
 "phosphorescence, like a far away constellation of stars. Relieved\n"
 "against the ghostly light, the gigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up\n"
 "to thrice his real stature, and seemed the black cloud from which the\n"
 "thunder had come.  The parted mouth of Tashtego revealed his\n"
 "shark-white teeth, which strangely gleamed as if they too\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by the\n"
 "preternatural light, Queequeg's tattooing burned like Satanic blue\n"
 "flames on his body.  The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness\n"
 "aloft; and once more the Pequod and every soul on her decks were\n"
 "wrapped in a pall. A moment or two passed, when Starbuck, going\n"
 "forward, pushed against some one. It was Stubb.  \"What thinkest thou\n"
 "now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not the same in the song.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\"No, no, it wasn't; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I\n"
 "hope they will, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces? -\n"
 "have they no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck - but it's\n"
 "too dark to look. Hear me, then: I take that mast-head flame we saw\n"
 "for a sign of good luck; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is\n"
 "going to be chock a' block with sperm-oil, d'ye see; and so, all that\n"
 "sperm will work up into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our three\n"
 "masts will yet be as three spermaceti candles - that's the good\n"
 "promise we saw.\"  At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb's face\n"
 "slowly beginning to glimmer into sight. Glancing upwards, he cried:\n"
 "\"See! see!\" and once more the high tapering flames were beheld with\n"
 "what seemed redoubled supernaturalness in their pallor.  \"The\n"
 "corpusants have mercy on us all,\" cried Stubb, again.  At the base of\n"
 "the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame, the parsee was\n"
 "kneeling in Ahab's front, but with his head bowed away from him; while\n"
 "near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where they had just\n"
 "been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen, arrested by the\n"
 "glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a knot of numbed\n"
 "wasps from a drooping, orchard twig. In various enchanted attitudes,\n"
 "like the standing, or stepping, or running skeletons in Herculaneum,\n"
 "others remained rooted to the deck; but all their eyes upcast.  \"Aye,\n"
 "aye, men!\" cried Ahab. \"Look up at it; mark it well; the white flame\n"
 "but lights the way to the White Whale! Hand me those main-mast links\n"
 "there; I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against it;\n"
 "blood against fire! So.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Then turning - the last link held fast in his left hand, he\n"
 "put his foot upon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-\n"
 "flung right arm, he stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity\n"
 "of flames.  \"Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I\n"
 "as Persian once did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by\n"
 "thee, that to this hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear\n"
 "spirit, and I now know that thy right worship is defiance. To neither\n"
 "love nor reverence wilt thou be kind; and e'en for hate thou canst but\n"
 "kill; and all are killed. No fearless fool now fronts thee.\"  Sudden,\n"
 "repeated flshes of lightning; the nine flames leap length-wise to\n"
 "thrice their previous height; Ahah, with the rest, closes his eyes,\n"
 "his right hand pressed hard upon them.  \"I own thy speechless,\n"
 "placeless power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will\n"
 "dispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me. In the midst of\n"
 "the personified impersonal, a personality stands here. Though but a\n"
 "point at best; whencesoe'er I came; wheresoe'er I go; yet while I\n"
 "earthly live, the queenly personality lives in me, and feels her royal\n"
 "rights. But war is pain, and hate is woe. Come in thy lowest form of\n"
 "love, and I will kneel and kiss thee; but at thy highest, come as mere\n"
 "supernal power; and though thou launchest navies of full-freighted\n"
 "worlds, there's that in here that still remains indifferent. Oh, thou\n"
 "clear spirit, of thy fire thou madest me, and like a true child of\n"
 "fire, I breathe it back to thee. [Sudden, repeated flashes of\n"
 "lightning; the nine flames leap lengthwise to thrice their previous\n"
 "height; Ahab, with the rest, closes his eyes, his right hand pressed\n"
 "hard upon them.] I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so?\n"
 "Nor was it wrung from me; nor do I now drop these links. Thou canst\n"
 "blind; but I can then grope. Thou canst consume; but I can then be\n"
 "ashes. Take the homage of these poor eyes, and shutter-hands. I would\n"
 "not take it. The lightning flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls\n"
 "ache and ache; my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on\n"
 "some stunning ground. Oh, oh! Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to\n"
 "thee. Light though thou be, thou leapest out of darkness; but I am\n"
 "darkness leaping out of light, leaping out of thee! The javelins\n"
 "cease; open eyes; see, or not? There burn the flames! Oh, thou\n"
 "magnanimous! now do I glory in my genealogy. But thou art but my fiery\n"
 "father; my sweet mother, I know not. Oh, cruel! what hast\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " thou done with her? There lies my puzzle; but thine is\n"
 "greater. Thou knowest not how came ye, hence callest thyself\n"
 "unbegotten; certainly knowest not thy beginning, hence callest thyself\n"
 "unbegun. I know that of me, which thou knowest not of thyself, oh,\n"
 "thou omnipotent. There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou\n"
 "clear spirit, to whom all thy eternity is but time, all thy\n"
 "creativeness mechanical. Through thee, thy flaming self, my scorched\n"
 "eyes do dimly see it. Oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial,\n"
 "thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated\n"
 "grief. Here again with haughty agony, i read my sire. leap! leap up,\n"
 "and lick the sky! I leap with thee; I burn with thee; would fain be\n"
 "welded with thee; defyingly I worship thee!\"  \"The boat! the boat!\"\n"
 "cried Starbuck, \"look at thy boat, old man!\"  Ahab's harpoon, the one\n"
 "forged at Perth's fire, remained firmly lashed in its conspicuous\n"
 "crotch, so that it projected beyond his whale- boat's bow; but the sea\n"
 "that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop\n"
 "off; and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of\n"
 "pale, forked fire. As the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent's\n"
 "tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm - \"God, God is against thee,\n"
 "old man; forbear! t'is an ill voyage! ill begun, ill continued; let me\n"
 "square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a fair wind of it\n"
 "homewards, to go on a better voyage than this.\"  Overhearing Starbuck,\n"
 "the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the braces - though not a\n"
 "sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghast mate's thoughts\n"
 "seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. But dashing the\n"
 "rattling lightning links to the deck, and snatching the burning\n"
 "harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among them; swearing to transfix\n"
 "with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope's end. Petrified\n"
 "by his aspect, and still more shrinking from the fiery dart that he\n"
 "held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab again spoke: - \"All your\n"
 "oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and heart, soul,\n"
 "and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound. And that ye may know to\n"
 "what tune this heart beats;\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " look ye here; thus I blow out the last fear!\" And with one\n"
 "blast of his breath he extinguished the flame.  As in the hurricane\n"
 "that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood of some lone, gigantic\n"
 "elm, whose very height and strength but render it so much the more\n"
 "unsafe, because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts; so at those\n"
 "last words of Ahab's many of the mariners did run from him in a terror\n"
 "of dismay.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Ahab standing by the helm. Starbuck approaching him.  \"We\n"
 "must send down the main-top-sail yard, Sir. The band is working loose,\n"
 "and the lee lift is half-stranded. Shall I strike it, Sir?\"  \"Strike\n"
 "nothing; lash it. If I had sky-sail poles, I'd sway them up now.\"\n"
 "\"Sir? - in God's name! - Sir?\"  \"Well.\"  \"The anchors are working,\n"
 "Sir. Shall I get them inboard?\"  \"Strike nothing, and stir nothing,\n"
 "but lash everything. The wind rises, but it has not got up to my\n"
 "table-lands yet. Quick, and see to it. - By masts and keels! he takes\n"
 "me for the hunch-backed skipper of some coasting smack. Send down my\n"
 "main-top-sail yard! Ho, gluepots! Loftiest trucks were made for\n"
 "wildest winds, and this brain-truck of mine now sails amid the\n"
 "cloud-scud. Shall I strike that? Oh, none but cowards send down their\n"
 "brain-trucks in tempest time.  What a hooroosh aloft there! I would\n"
 "e'en take it for sublime, did I not know that the colic is a noisy\n"
 "malady. Oh, take medicine, take medicine!\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Stubb and Flask mounted on them, and passing additional\n"
 "lashings over the anchors there hanging.  \"No, Stubb; you may pound\n"
 "that knot there as much as you please, but you will never pound into\n"
 "me what you were just now saying. And how long ago is it since you\n"
 "said the very contrary? Didn't you once say that whatever ship Ahab\n"
 "sails in, that ship should pay something extra on its insurance\n"
 "policy, just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft and\n"
 "boxes of lucifers forward? Stop, now; didn't you say so?\"  \"Well,\n"
 "suppose I did? What then? i've part changed my flesh since that time,\n"
 "why not my mind? Besides, supposing we are loaded with powder barrels\n"
 "aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the lucifers get afire\n"
 "in this drenching spray here? Why, my little man, you have pretty red\n"
 "hair, but you couldn't get afire now. Shake yourself; you're Aquarius,\n"
 "or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill pitchers at your coat\n"
 "collar. Don't you see, then, that for these extra risks the Marine\n"
 "Insurance companies have extra guarantees? Here are hydrants,\n"
 "Flask. But hark, again, and I'll answer ye the other thing. First take\n"
 "your leg off from the crown of the anchor here, though, so I can pass\n"
 "the rope; now listen. What's the mighty difference between holding a\n"
 "mast's lightning- rod in the storm, and standing close by a mast that\n"
 "hasn't got any lightning-rod at all in a storm? Don't you see, you\n"
 "timber-head, that no harm can come to the holder of the rod, unless\n"
 "the mast is first struck? What are you talking about, then?  Not one\n"
 "ship in a hundred carries rods, and Ahab, - aye, man, and all of us, -\n"
 "were in no more danger then, in my poor opinion, than all the crews in\n"
 "ten thousand ships now sailing the seas. Why, you King- Post, you, I\n"
 "suppose you would have every man in the world go about\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " with a small lightning-rod running up the corner of his hat,\n"
 "like a militia officer's skewered feather, and trailing behind like\n"
 "his sash. Why don't ye be sensible, Flask? it's easy to be sensible;\n"
 "why don't ye, then? any man with half an eye can be sensible.\"  \"I\n"
 "don't know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather hard.\"  \"Yes,\n"
 "when a fellow's soaked through, it's hard to be sensible, that's a\n"
 "fact.  And I am about drenched with this spray. Never mind; catch the\n"
 "turn there, and pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors\n"
 "now as if they were never going to be used again. tying these two\n"
 "anchors here, Flask, seems like tying a man's hands behind him. And\n"
 "what big generous hands they are, to be sure. These are your iron\n"
 "fists, hey? What a hold they have, too! I wonder, Flask, whether the\n"
 "world is anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings with an uncommon\n"
 "long cable, though. There, hammer that knot down, and we've done. So;\n"
 "next to touching land, lighting on deck is the most satisfactory. I\n"
 "say, just wring out my jacket skirts, will ye? Thank ye. They laugh at\n"
 "long-togs so, Flask; but seems to me, a long tailed coat ought always\n"
 "to be worn in all storms afloat.  The tails tapering down that way,\n"
 "serve to carry off the water, d'ye see. Same with cocked hats; the\n"
 "cocks form gable-end eave-troughs, Flask. No more monkey-jackets and\n"
 "tarpaulins for me; I must mount a swallow-tail, and drive down a\n"
 "beaver; so. Halloa! whew! there goes my tarpaulin overboard; Lord,\n"
 "Lord, that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly!\n"
 "This is a nasty night, lad.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " The Main-top-sail yard. - Tashtego passing new lashings\n"
 "around it.  \"Um, um, um. Stop that thunder! Plenty too much thunder up\n"
 "here. What's the use of thunder? Um, um, um. We don't want thunder; we\n"
 "want rum; give us a glass of rum. Um, um, um!\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " During the most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the\n"
 "Pequod's jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to\n"
 "the deck by its spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles had\n"
 "been attached to it - for they were slack - because some play to the\n"
 "tiller was indispensable. In a severe gale like this, while the ship\n"
 "is but a tossed shuttle-cock to the blast, it is by no means uncommon\n"
 "to see the needles in the compasses, at intervals, go round and\n"
 "round. It was thus with the Pequod's; at almost every shock the\n"
 "helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which\n"
 "they revolved upon the cards; it is a sight that hardly any one can\n"
 "behold without some sort of unwonted emotion. Some hours after\n"
 "midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through the strenuous\n"
 "exertions of Starbuck and Stubb - one engaged forward and the other\n"
 "aft - the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main-top-sails\n"
 "were cut adrift from the spars, and went eddying away to leeward, like\n"
 "the feathers of\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " an albatross, which sometimes are cast to the winds when that\n"
 "storm-tossed bird is on the wing. The three corresponding new sails\n"
 "were now bent and reefed, and a storm-trysail was set further aft; so\n"
 "that the ship soon went through the water with some precision again;\n"
 "and the course - for the present, East- south-east - which he was to\n"
 "steer, if practicable, was once more given to the helmsman. For during\n"
 "the violence of the gale, he had only steered according to its\n"
 "vicissitudes. But as he was now bringing the ship as near her course\n"
 "as possible, watching the compass meanwhile, lo! a good sign! the wind\n"
 "seemed coming round astern; aye! the foul breeze became fair!\n"
 "Instantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of \"Ho! the fair\n"
 "wind!  oh-he-yo, cheerly, men!\" the crew singing for joy, that so\n"
 "promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents\n"
 "preceding it.  In compliance with the standing order of his commander\n"
 "- to report immediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours, any\n"
 "decided change in the affairs of the deck, - Starbuck had no sooner\n"
 "trimmed the yards to the breeze - however reluctantly and gloomily, -\n"
 "than he mechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the\n"
 "circumstance.  Ere knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused\n"
 "before it a moment. The cabin lamp - taking long swings this way and\n"
 "that - was burning fitfully, and casting fitful shadows upon the old\n"
 "man's bolted door, - a thin one, with fixed blinds inserted, in place\n"
 "of upper panels. The isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a\n"
 "certain humming silence to reign there, though it was hooped round by\n"
 "all the roar of the elements. The loaded muskets in the rack were\n"
 "shiningly revealed, as they stood upright against the forward\n"
 "bulkhead. Starbuck was an honest, upright man; but out of Starbuck's\n"
 "heart, at that instant when he saw the muskets, there strangely\n"
 "evolved an evil thought; but so blent with its neutral or good\n"
 "accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself.  \"He\n"
 "would have shot me once,\" he murmured, \"yes, there's the very musket\n"
 "that he pointed at me; - that one with the studded stock; let me touch\n"
 "it - lift it.  Strange, that I, who have\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " handled so many deadly lances, strange, that I should shake\n"
 "so now. Loaded? I must see. Aye, aye; and powder in the pan; - that's\n"
 "not good. Best spill it? - wait. I'll cure myself of this. I'll hold\n"
 "the musket boldly while I think. - I come to report a fair wind to\n"
 "him. But how fair? Fair for death and doom, - that's fair for Moby\n"
 "Dick. It's a fair wind that's only fair for that accursed fish. - The\n"
 "very tube he pointed at me! - the very one; this one - I hold it here;\n"
 "he would have killed me with the very thing I handle now. - Aye and he\n"
 "would fain kill all his crew. Does he not say he will not strike his\n"
 "spars to any gale? Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant? and in\n"
 "these same perilous seas, gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning\n"
 "of the error-abounding log?  and in this very Typhoon, did he not\n"
 "swear that he would have no lightning-rods?  But shall this crazed old\n"
 "man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship's company down to doom\n"
 "with him? - Yes, it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men\n"
 "and more, if this ship come to any deadly harm; and come to deadly\n"
 "harm, my soul swears this ship will, if Ahab have his way. If, then,\n"
 "he were this instant - put aside, that crime would not be his. Ha! is\n"
 "he muttering in his sleep? Yes, just there, - in there, he's\n"
 "sleeping. Sleeping? aye, but still alive, and soon awake again. I\n"
 "can't withstand thee, then, old man. Not reasoning; not remonstrance;\n"
 "not entreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this thou scornest. Flat\n"
 "obedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou breathest. Aye,\n"
 "and say'st the men have vow'd thy vow; say'st all of us are\n"
 "Ahabs. Great God forbid! - But is there no other way? no lawful way? -\n"
 "Make him a prisoner to be taken home?  What! hope to wrest this old\n"
 "man's living power from his own living hands? Only a fool would try\n"
 "it. Say he were pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and\n"
 "hawsers; chained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would be\n"
 "more hideous than a caged tiger, then. I could not endure the sight;\n"
 "could not possibly fly his howlings; all comfort, sleep itself,\n"
 "inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable\n"
 "voyage. What, then, remains? The land is hundreds of leagues away, and\n"
 "locked Japan the nearest. I stand alone here upon an open sea, with\n"
 "two oceans and a whole continent between me and law. - Aye, aye, 'tis\n"
 "so. - Is heaven a murderer\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " when its lightning strikes a would-be murderer in his bed,\n"
 "tindering sheets and skin together? - And would I be a murderer, then,\n"
 "if - and slowly, stealthily, and half sideways looking, he placed the\n"
 "loaded musket's end against the door.  \"On this level, Ahab's hammock\n"
 "swings within; his head this way. A touch, and Starbuck may survive to\n"
 "hug his wife and child again. - Oh Mary! Mary! - boy!  boy! boy! - But\n"
 "if I wake thee not to death, old man, who can tell to what unsounded\n"
 "deeps Starbuck's body this day week may sink, with all the crew! Great\n"
 "God, where art thou? Shall I? shall I? - The wind has gone down and\n"
 "shifted, Sir; the fore and main topsails are reefed and set; she heads\n"
 "her course.\"  \"Stern all! Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!\"\n"
 "Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man's\n"
 "tormented sleep, as if Starbuck's voice had caused the long dumb dream\n"
 "to speak.  The yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard's arm against\n"
 "the panel; Starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel; but turning from\n"
 "the door, he placed the death-tube in its rack, and left the place.\n"
 "\"He's too sound asleep, Mr Stubb; go thou down, and wake him, and tell\n"
 "him. I must see to the deck here. Thou know'st what to say.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow\n"
 "billows of mighty bulk, and striving in the Pequod's gurgling track,\n"
 "pushed her on like giants' palms outspread. The strong, unstaggering\n"
 "breeze abounded so, that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails;\n"
 "the whole world boomed before the wind. Muffled in the full morning\n"
 "light, the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his\n"
 "place; where his bayonet\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " rays moved on in stacks. Emblazonings, as of crowned\n"
 "Babylonian kings and queens, reigned over everything. The sea was as a\n"
 "crucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps with light and heat.\n"
 "Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every\n"
 "time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned\n"
 "to eye the bright sun's rays produced ahead; and when she profoundly\n"
 "settled by the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun's rearward\n"
 "place, and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating\n"
 "wake.  \"Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the\n"
 "sea-chariot of the sun. Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, I bring\n"
 "the sun to ye! Yoke on the further billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive\n"
 "the sea!\"  But suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he\n"
 "hurried towards the helm, huskily demanding how the ship was heading.\n"
 "\"East-sou- east, Sir,\" said the frightened steersman.  \"Thou liest!\"\n"
 "smiting him with his clenched fist. \"Heading East at this hour in the\n"
 "morning, and the sun astern?\"  Upon this every soul was confounded;\n"
 "for the phenomenon just then observed by Ahab had unaccountably\n"
 "escaped every one else; but its very blinding palpableness must have\n"
 "been the cause.  Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab\n"
 "caught one glimpse of the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for\n"
 "a moment he almost seemed to stagger. Standing behind him Starbuck\n"
 "looked, and lo! the two compasses pointed East, and the Pequod was as\n"
 "infallibly going West.  But ere the first wild alarm could get out\n"
 "abroad among the crew, the old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, \"I\n"
 "have it! It has happened before. Mr. Starbuck, last night's thunder\n"
 "turned our compasses - that's all. Thou hast before now heard of such\n"
 "a thing, I take it.\"  \"Aye; but never before has it happened to me,\n"
 "Sir, said the pale mate, gloomily.\n"
 "\n"
 "Here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more\n"
 "than one case occurred to ships in violent storms. The\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " magnetic energy, as developed in the mariner's needle, is, as\n"
 "all know, essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven; hence\n"
 "it is not to be much marvelled at, that such things should be. In\n"
 "instances where the lightning has actually struck the vessel, so as to\n"
 "smite down some of the spars and rigging, the effect upon the needle\n"
 "has at times been still more fatal; all its loadstone virtue being\n"
 "annihilated, so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use than\n"
 "an old wife's knitting needle. But in either case, the needle never\n"
 "again, of itself, recovers the original virtue thus marred or lost;\n"
 "and if the binnacle compasses be affected, the same fate reaches all\n"
 "the others that may be in the ship; even were the lowermost one\n"
 "inserted into the kelson.  Deliberately standing before the binnacle,\n"
 "and eyeing the transpointed compasses, the old man, with the sharp of\n"
 "his extended hand, now took the precise bearing of the sun, and\n"
 "satisfied that the needles were exactly inverted, shouted out his\n"
 "orders for the ship's course to be changed accordingly. The yards were\n"
 "hard up; and once more the Pequod thrust her undaunted bows into the\n"
 "opposing wind, for the supposed fair one had only been juggling her.\n"
 "Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said\n"
 "nothing, but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and\n"
 "Flask - who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his\n"
 "feelings - likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced. As for the men, though\n"
 "some of them lowly rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their\n"
 "fear of Fate. But as ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained\n"
 "almost wholly unimpressed; or if impressed, it was only with a certain\n"
 "magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab's.\n"
 "For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries. But\n"
 "chancing to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper\n"
 "sight-tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck.\n"
 "\"Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun's pilot! yesterday I wrecked\n"
 "thee, and to- day the compasses would feign have wrecked me. So,\n"
 "so. But Ahab is lord over the level load-stone\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " yet. Mr. Starbuck - a lance without a pole; a top-maul, and\n"
 "the smallest of the sail-maker's needles. Quick!  Accessory, perhaps,\n"
 "to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about to do, were\n"
 "certain prudential motives, whose object might have been to revive the\n"
 "spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill, in a matter so\n"
 "wondrous as that of the inverted compasses. Besides, the old man well\n"
 "knew that to steer by transpointed needles, though clumsily\n"
 "practicable, was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious\n"
 "sailors, without some shudderings and evil portents.  \"Men,\" said he,\n"
 "steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed him the things he\n"
 "had demanded, \"my men, the thunder turned old Ahab's needles; but out\n"
 "of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own, that will point as\n"
 "true as any.\"  Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the\n"
 "sailors, as this was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited\n"
 "whatever magic might follow. But Starbuck looked away.  With a blow\n"
 "from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance, and\n"
 "then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade him hold it\n"
 "upright, without its touching the deck. Then, with the maul, after\n"
 "repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he placed the\n"
 "blunted needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly hammered\n"
 "that, several times, the mate still holding the rod as before. Then\n"
 "going through some small strange motions with it - whether\n"
 "indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel, or merely intended to\n"
 "augment the awe of the crew, is uncertain - he called for linen\n"
 "thread; and moving to the binnacle, slipped out the two reversed\n"
 "needles there, and horizontally suspended the sail-needle by its\n"
 "middle, over one of the compass-cards. At first, the steel went round\n"
 "and round, quivering and vibrating at either end; but at last it\n"
 "settled to its place, when Ahab, who had been intently watching for\n"
 "this result, stepped frankly back from the binnacle, and pointing his\n"
 "stretched arm towards it, exclaimed, - \"Look ye, for yourselves, if\n"
 "Ahab be not the lord of the level loadstone! The sun is East, and that\n"
 "compass swears it!\"  One after another they peered in, for nothing but\n"
 "their own\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " eyes could persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after\n"
 "another they slunk away.  In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you\n"
 "then saw Ahab in all his fatal pride.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this\n"
 "voyage, the log and line had but very seldom been in use. Owing to a\n"
 "confident reliance upon other means of determining the vessel's place,\n"
 "some merchantmen, and many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly\n"
 "neglect to heave the log; though at the same time, and frequently more\n"
 "for form's sake than anything else, regularly putting down upon the\n"
 "customary slate the course steered by the ship, as well as the\n"
 "presumed average rate of progression every hour. It had been thus with\n"
 "the Pequod. The wooden reel and angular log attached hung, long\n"
 "untouched, just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks. Rains and\n"
 "spray had damped it; the sun and wind had warped it; all the elements\n"
 "had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly. But heedless of all\n"
 "this, his mood seized Ahab, as he happened to glance upon the reel,\n"
 "not many hours after the magnet scene, and he remembered how his\n"
 "quadrant was no more, and recalled his frantic oath about the level\n"
 "log and line. The ship was sailing plungingly; astern the billows\n"
 "rolled in riots.  \"Forward, there! Heave the log!\"  Two seamen\n"
 "came. The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman. \"Take the\n"
 "reel, one of ye, I'll heave.\"  They went towards the extreme stern, on\n"
 "the ship's lee side, where the deck, with the oblique energy of the\n"
 "wind, was now almost dipping into the creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.\n"
 "The Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting\n"
 "handle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " of line revolved, so stood with the angular log hanging\n"
 "downwards, till Ahab advanced to him.  Ahab stood before him, and was\n"
 "lightly unwinding some thirty or forty turns to form a preliminary\n"
 "hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old Manxman, who was intently\n"
 "eyeing both him and the line, made bold to speak.  \"Sir, I mistrust\n"
 "it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have spoiled it.\"\n"
 "\"'Twill hold, old gentleman. Long heat and wet, have they spoiled\n"
 "thee? Thou seem'st to hold. Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee; not\n"
 "thou it.\"  \"I hold the spool, Sir. But just as my captain says. With\n"
 "these grey hairs of mine 'tis not worth while disputing, 'specially\n"
 "with a superior, who'll ne'er confess.\"  \"What's that? There now's a\n"
 "patched professor in Queen Nature's granite-founded College; but\n"
 "methinks he's too subservient. Where wert thou born?\"  \"In the little\n"
 "rocky Isle of Man, Sir.\"  \"Excellent! Thou'st hit the world by that.\"\n"
 "\"I know not, Sir, but I was born there.\"  \"In the Isle of Man, hey?\n"
 "Well, the other way, it's good. Here's a man from Man; a man born in\n"
 "once independent Man, and now unmanned of Man; which is sucked in - by\n"
 "what? Up with the reel! The dead, blind wall butts all inquiring heads\n"
 "at last. Up with it! So.\"  The log was heaved. The loose coils rapidly\n"
 "straightened out in a long dragging line astern, and then, instantly,\n"
 "the reel began to whirl. In turn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the\n"
 "rolling billows, the towing resistance of the log caused the old\n"
 "reelman to stagger strangely.  \"Hold hard!\"  Snap! the overstrained\n"
 "line sagged down in one long festoon; the tugging log was gone.  \"I\n"
 "crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad sea\n"
 "parts the log-line. But Ahab can mend all. Haul in here, Tahitian;\n"
 "reel up, Manxman.  And look ye, let the carpenter make another log,\n"
 "and mend thou the line. See to it.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"There he goes now; to him nothing's happened; but to me, the\n"
 "skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world. Haul in, haul\n"
 "in, Tahitian! These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken,\n"
 "and dragging slow. Ha, Pip?  come to help; eh, Pip?\"  \"Pip? whom call\n"
 "ye Pip? Pip jumped from the whale-boat. pip's missing. let's see now\n"
 "if ye haven't fished him up here, fisherman. It drags hard; I guess\n"
 "he's holding on. Jerk him, Tahiti! Jerk him off; we haul in no cowards\n"
 "here. Ho!  there's his arm just breaking water. A hatchet! a hatchet!\n"
 "cut it off - we haul in no cowards here. Captain Ahab! Sir, Sir!\n"
 "here's Pip, trying to get on board again.\"  \"Peace, thou crazy loon,\"\n"
 "cried the Manxman, seizing him by the arm. \"Away from the quarter-\n"
 "deck!\"  \"The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser,\" muttered Ahab,\n"
 "advancing. \"Hands off from that holiness! Where sayest thou Pip was,\n"
 "boy?\"  \"Astern there, Sir, astern! Lo, lo!\"  \"And who art thou, boy? I\n"
 "see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of thy eyes. Oh God! that\n"
 "man should be a thing for immortal souls to sieve through!  Who art\n"
 "thou, boy?\"  \"Bell-boy, Sir; ship's-crier; ding, dong, ding! Pip! Pip!\n"
 "Pip! One hundred pounds of clay reward for Pip; five feet high - looks\n"
 "cowardly - quickest known by that! Ding, dong, ding! Who's seen Pip\n"
 "the coward?\"  \"There can be no hearts above the snow-line. Oh, ye\n"
 "frozen heavens! look down here. Ye did beget this luckless child, and\n"
 "have abandoned him, ye creative libertines. Here, boy; Ahab's cabin\n"
 "shall be Pip's home henceforth, while Ahab lives. Thou touchest my\n"
 "inmost centre, boy; thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-\n"
 "strings. Come, let's down.\"  \"What's this? here's velvet shark-skin,\n"
 "intently gazing at Ahab's hand, and feeling it. Ah, now, had poor Pip\n"
 "but felt so kind a thing as this, perhaps he had ne'er been lost! This\n"
 "seems to me, Sir, as a man-rope; something that weak souls may hold\n"
 "by. Oh, Sir, let old Perth now come and rivet these two hands\n"
 "together; the black one with the white, for I will not let this go.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"Oh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee\n"
 "to worse horrors than are here. come, then, to my cabin. Lo! ye\n"
 "believers in gods all goodness, and in man all ill, lo you! see the\n"
 "omniscient gods oblivious of suffering man; and man, though idiotic,\n"
 "and knowing not what he does, yet full of the sweet things of love and\n"
 "gratitude. Come! I feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand, than\n"
 "though I grasped an Emperor's!\"  \"There go two daft ones now, muttered\n"
 "the old Manxman. One daft with strength, the other daft with\n"
 "weakness. But here's the end of the rotten line - all dripping,\n"
 "too. Mend it, eh? I think we had best have a new line altogether. I'll\n"
 "see Mr. Stubb about it.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Steering now south-eastward by Ahab's levelled steel, and her\n"
 "progress solely determined by Ahab's level log and line; the Pequod\n"
 "held on her path towards the Equator. Making so long a passage through\n"
 "such unfrequented waters, descrying no ships, and ere long, sideways\n"
 "impelled by unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously mild; all\n"
 "these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and\n"
 "desperate scene.  At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts,\n"
 "as it were, of the Equatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness\n"
 "that goes before the dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets;\n"
 "the watch - then headed by Flask - was startled by a cry so\n"
 "plaintively wild and unearthly - like half-articulated wailings of the\n"
 "ghosts of all Herod's murdered Innocents - that one and all, they\n"
 "started from their reveries, and for the space of some moments stood,\n"
 "or sat, or leaned all transfixedly listening, like the carved Roman\n"
 "slave, while that wild cry remained within hearing. The Christian or\n"
 "civilized part of the crew said it was mermaids, and shuddered; but\n"
 "the pagan harpooneers remained\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " unappalled. Yet the grey Manxman - the oldest mariner of all\n"
 "- declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard, were the\n"
 "voices of newly drowned men in the sea.  Below in his hammock, Ahab\n"
 "did not hear of this till grey dawn, when he came to the deck; it was\n"
 "then recounted to him by Flask, not unaccompanied with hinted dark\n"
 "meanings. He hollowly laughed, and thus explained the wonder.  Those\n"
 "rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers of\n"
 "seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or some dams\n"
 "that had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and kept\n"
 "company with her, crying and sobbing with their human sort of\n"
 "wail. But this only the more affected some of them, because most\n"
 "mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals, arising not\n"
 "only from their peculiar tones when in distress, but also from the\n"
 "human look of their round heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen\n"
 "peeringly uprising from the water alongside. In the sea, under certain\n"
 "circumstances, seals have more than once been mistaken for men.  But\n"
 "the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible\n"
 "confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning. At\n"
 "sun-rise this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore;\n"
 "and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep (for\n"
 "sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state), whether it was thus\n"
 "with the man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may, he had\n"
 "not been long at his perch, when a cry was heard - a cry and a rushing\n"
 "- and looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and looking\n"
 "down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the sea.\n"
 "The life-buoy - a long slender cask - was dropped from the stern,\n"
 "where it always hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to\n"
 "seize it, and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken,\n"
 "so that it slowly filled, and the parched wood also filled at its\n"
 "every pore; and the studded iron- bound cask followed the sailor to\n"
 "the bottom, as if to yield him his pillow, though in sooth but a hard\n"
 "one.  And thus the first man of the pequod that mounted the mast to\n"
 "look out for the White Whale, on the White Whale's own\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " peculiar ground; that man was swallowed up in the deep. But\n"
 "few, perhaps, thought of that at the time. Indeed, in some sort, they\n"
 "were not grieved at this event, at least as a portent; for they\n"
 "regarded it, not as a foreshadowing of evil in the future, but as the\n"
 "fulfilment of an evil already presaged. They declared that now they\n"
 "knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had heard the night\n"
 "before. But again the old Manxman said nay.  The lost life-buoy was\n"
 "now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to see to it; but as no cask\n"
 "of sufficient lightness could be found, and as in the feverish\n"
 "eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage, all\n"
 "hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly connected with\n"
 "its final end, whatever that might prove to be; therefore, they were\n"
 "going to leave the ship's stern unprovided with a buoy, when by\n"
 "certain strange signs and inuendoes Queequeg hinted a hint concerning\n"
 "his coffin.  \"A life-buoy of a coffin!\" cried Starbuck, starting.\n"
 "\"Rather queer, that, I should say,\" said Stubb.  \"It will make a good\n"
 "enough one,\" said Flask, \"the carpenter here can arrange it easily.\"\n"
 "\"Bring it up; there's nothing else for it,\" said Starbuck, after a\n"
 "melancholy pause. \"Rig it, carpenter; do not look at me so - the\n"
 "coffin, I mean. Dost thou hear me? Rig it.\"  \"And shall I nail down\n"
 "the lid, Sir?\" moving his hand as with a hammer.  \"Aye.\"  \"And shall I\n"
 "caulk the seams, Sir?\" moving his hand as with a caulking-iron.\n"
 "\"Aye.\"  \"And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, Sir?\" moving\n"
 "his hand as with a pitch- pot.  \"Away! What possesses thee to this?\n"
 "Make a life-buoy of the coffin, and no more.  - Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask,\n"
 "come forward with me.\"  \"He goes off in a huff. The whole he can\n"
 "endure; at the parts he baulks. Now I don't like this. i make a leg\n"
 "for captain Ahab, and he wears it like a gentleman; but I make a\n"
 "bandbox for Queequeg, and he wont put his head into it.  Are\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin? And now I'm\n"
 "ordered to make a life-buoy of it. It's like turning an old coat;\n"
 "going to bring the flesh on the other side now. I don't like this\n"
 "cobbling sort of business - I don't like it at all; it's undignified;\n"
 "it's not my place. Let tinkers' brats do tinkerings; we are their\n"
 "betters. I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin,\n"
 "fair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that regularly begins at\n"
 "the beginning, and is at the middle when midway, and comes to an end\n"
 "at the conclusion; not a cobbler's job, that's at an end in the\n"
 "middle, and at the beginning at the end. It's the old woman's tricks\n"
 "to be giving cobbling jobs.  Lord! what an affection all old women\n"
 "have for tinkers. I know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away with\n"
 "a bald-headed young tinker once. And that's the reason I never would\n"
 "work for lonely widow old women ashore, when I kept my job-shop in the\n"
 "Vineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run\n"
 "off with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let\n"
 "me see. Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with\n"
 "pitch; batten them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over\n"
 "the ship's stern. Were ever such things done before with a coffin?\n"
 "Some superstitious old carpenters, now, would be tied up in the\n"
 "rigging, ere they would do the job. But I'm made of knotty Aroostook\n"
 "hemlock; I don't budge. Cruppered with a coffin! Sailing about with a\n"
 "grave-yard tray! But never mind. We workers in woods make\n"
 "bridal-bedsteads and card-tables, as well as coffins and hearses. We\n"
 "work by the month, or by the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask\n"
 "the why and wherefore of our work, unless it be too confounded\n"
 "cobbling, and then we stash it if we can. hem! i'll do the job, now,\n"
 "tenderly. I'll have me - let's see - how many in the ship's company,\n"
 "all told? But I've forgotten. Any way, I'll have me thirty separate,\n"
 "Turk's- headed life-lines, each three feet long hanging all round to\n"
 "the coffin. Then, if the hull go down, there'll be thirty lively\n"
 "fellows all fighting for one coffin, a sight not seen very often\n"
 "beneath the sun! Come hammer, calking-iron, pitch-pot, and\n"
 "marling-spike! Let's to it.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " The coffin laid upon two line-tubs, between the vice-bench\n"
 "and the open hatchway; the Carpenter calking its seams; the string of\n"
 "twisted oakum slowly unwinding from a large roll of it placed in the\n"
 "bosom of his frock. - Ahab comes slowly from the cabin- gangway, and\n"
 "hears Pip following him.  \" Back, lad; I will be with ye again\n"
 "presently. He goes! Not this hand complies with my humor more genially\n"
 "than that boy. - Middle aisle of a church! What's here?\"  \"Life buoy,\n"
 "Sir. Mr. Starbuck's orders. Oh, look, Sir! Beware the hatchway!\"\n"
 "\"Thank ye, man. Thy coffin lies handy to the vault.\"  \"Sir? The\n"
 "hatchway? oh! So it does, Sir, so it does.\"  \"Art not thou the\n"
 "leg-maker? Look, did not this stump come from thy shop?\"  \"I believe\n"
 "it did, Sir; does the ferrule stand, Sir?\"  \"Well enough. But art thou\n"
 "not also the undertaker?\"  \"Aye, Sir; I patched up this thing here as\n"
 "a coffin for Queequeg; but they've set me now to turning it into\n"
 "something else.\"  \"Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping,\n"
 "inter-meddling, monopolizing, heathenish old scamp, to be one day\n"
 "making legs, and the next day coffins to clap them in, and yet again\n"
 "life-buoys out of those same coffins?  Thou art as unprincipled as the\n"
 "gods, and as much of a jack-of-all- trades.\"  \"But I do not mean\n"
 "anything, Sir. I do as I do.\"  \"The gods again. hark ye, dost thou not\n"
 "ever sing working about a coffin? The Titans, they say, hummed\n"
 "snatches when chipping out the craters for volcanoes; and the\n"
 "grave-digger in the play sings, spade in hand. Dost thou never?\"\n"
 "\"Sing, Sir? Do I sing? Oh, I'm indifferent enough, Sir, for that; but\n"
 "the reason why the grave- digger made music must\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " have been because there was none in his spade, Sir. But the\n"
 "calking mallet is full of it. Hark to it.\"  \"Aye, and that's because\n"
 "the lid there's a sounding- board; and what in all things makes the\n"
 "sounding-board is this - there's naught beneath. And yet, a coffin\n"
 "with a body in it rings pretty much the same, Carpenter. Hast thou\n"
 "ever helped carry a bier, and heard the coffin knock against the\n"
 "churchyard gate, going in?\"  \"Faith, Sir, I've - \" \"Faith? What's\n"
 "that?\"  \"Why, faith, Sir, it's only a sort of exclamation-like -\n"
 "that's all, Sir.\"  \"Um, um; go on.\"  \"I was about to say, Sir, that -\n"
 "\" \"Art thou a silk-worm? Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself?\n"
 "Look at thy bosom! Despatch! and get these traps out of sight.\"  \"He\n"
 "goes aft. That was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden in hot\n"
 "latitudes.  I've heard that the Isle of Albemarle, one of the\n"
 "Gallipagos, is cut by the Equator right in the middle. Seems to me\n"
 "some sort of Equator cuts yon old man, too, right in his middle. He's\n"
 "always under the Line - fiery hot, I tell ye!  He's looking this way -\n"
 "come, oakum; quick. Here we go again. This wooden mallet is the cork,\n"
 "and I'm the professor of musical glasses - tap, tap!\"  Ahab to\n"
 "himself.  \"There's a sight! There's sound! The greyheaded woodpecker\n"
 "tapping the hollow tree! Blind and dumb might well be envied now. See!\n"
 "that thing rests on two line-tubs, full of tow- lines. A most\n"
 "malicious wag, that fellow. Rat-tat! So man's seconds tick! Oh! how\n"
 "immaterial are all materials! What things real are there, but\n"
 "imponderable thoughts? Here now's the very dreaded symbol of grim\n"
 "death, by a mere hap, made the expressive sign of the help and hope of\n"
 "most endangered life. A life-buoy of a coffin! Does it go further? Can\n"
 "it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is, after all, but an\n"
 "immortality-preserver!  I'll think of that. But no. So far gone\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " am I in the dark side of earth, that its other side, the\n"
 "theoretic bright one, seems but uncertain twilight to me. Will ye\n"
 "never have done, Carpenter, with that accursed sound? I go below; let\n"
 "me not see that thing here when I return again. Now, then, Pip, we'll\n"
 "talk this over; I do suck most wondrous philosophies from thee! Some\n"
 "unknown conduits from the unknown worlds must empty into thee!\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Next day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing\n"
 "directly down upon the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with\n"
 "men. At the time the Pequod was making good speed through the water;\n"
 "but as the broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the\n"
 "boastful sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst, and\n"
 "all life fled from the smitten hull.  \"Bad news; she brings bad news,\"\n"
 "muttered the old Manxman. But ere her commander, who, with trumpet to\n"
 "mouth, stood up in his boat; ere he could hopefully hail, Ahab's voice\n"
 "was heard.  \"Hast seen the White Whale?\"  \"Aye, yesterday. Have ye\n"
 "seen a whale-boat adrift?\"  Throttling his joy, Ahab negatively\n"
 "answered this unexpected question; and would then have fain boarded\n"
 "the stranger, when the stranger captain himself, having stopped his\n"
 "vessel's way, was seen descending her side. A few keen pulls, and his\n"
 "boat-hook soon clinched the Pequod's main- chains, and he sprang to\n"
 "the deck. Immediately he was recognized by Ahab for a nantucketer he\n"
 "knew. But no formal salutation was exchanged.  \"Where was he? - not\n"
 "killed! - not killed!\" cried Ahab, closely advancing. \"How was it?\"\n"
 "It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous,\n"
 "while three of the stranger's boats were engaged with\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " a shoal of whales, which had led them some four or five miles\n"
 "from the ship; and while they were yet in swift chase to windward, the\n"
 "white hump and head of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the\n"
 "blue water, not very far to leeward; whereupon, the fourth rigged boat\n"
 "- a reserved one - had been instantly lowered in chase. After a keen\n"
 "sail before the wind, this fourth boat - the swiftest keeled of all -\n"
 "seemed to have succeeded in fastening - at least, as well as the man\n"
 "at the mast-head could tell anything about it. In the distance he saw\n"
 "the diminished dotted boat; and then a swift gleam of bubbling white\n"
 "water; and after that nothing more; whence it was concluded that the\n"
 "stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers, as\n"
 "often happens. There was some apprehension, but no positive alarm, as\n"
 "yet. The recall signals were placed in the rigging; darkness came on;\n"
 "and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats - ere going in\n"
 "quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction - the ship\n"
 "had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate till\n"
 "near midnight, but, for the time, to increase her distance from\n"
 "it. But the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard, she crowded\n"
 "all sail - stunsail on stunsail - after the missing boat; kindling a\n"
 "fire in her try-pots for a beacon; and every other man aloft on the\n"
 "look-out. But though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to\n"
 "gain the presumed place of the absent ones when last seen; though she\n"
 "then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her; and not\n"
 "finding anything, had again dashed on; again paused, and lowered her\n"
 "boats; and though she had thus continued doing till day light; yet not\n"
 "the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen.  The story told,\n"
 "the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his object in\n"
 "boarding the Pequod. He desired that ship to unite with his own in the\n"
 "search; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart, on\n"
 "parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.  \"I will\n"
 "wager something now,\" whispered Stubb to Flask, \"that some one in that\n"
 "missing boat wore off that Captain's best coat; mayhap, his watch -\n"
 "he's so cursed anxious to get it back. Who ever heard of two pious\n"
 "whale-ships cruising after\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " one missing whale-boat in the height of the whaling season?\n"
 "See, Flask, only see how pale he looks - pale in the very buttons of\n"
 "his eyes - look - it wasn't the coat - it must have been the - \" \"My\n"
 "boy, my own boy is among them. For God's sake - I beg, I conjure -\n"
 "here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far had but\n"
 "icily received his petition. For eight-and-forty hours let me charter\n"
 "your ship - I will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for it - if\n"
 "there be no other way - for eight-and-forty hours only - only that -\n"
 "you must, oh, you must, and you shall do this thing.\"  \"His son!\"\n"
 "cried Stubb, \"oh, it's his son he's lost! I take back the coat and\n"
 "watch - what says Ahab? We must save that boy.\"  \"He's drowned with\n"
 "the rest on 'em, last night,\" said the old Manx sailor standing behind\n"
 "them; \"I heard; all of ye heard their spirits.\"  Now, as it shortly\n"
 "turned out, what made this incident of the Rachel's the more\n"
 "melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was one of the\n"
 "Captain's sons among the number of the missing boat's crew; but among\n"
 "the number of the other boat's crews, at the same time, but on the\n"
 "other hand, separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of\n"
 "the chase, there had been still another son; as that for a time, the\n"
 "wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity;\n"
 "which was only solved for him by his chief mate's instinctively\n"
 "adopting the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such emergencies,\n"
 "that is, when placed between jeopardized but divided boats, always to\n"
 "pick up the majority first. But the captain, for some unknown\n"
 "constitutional reason, had refrained from mentioning all this, and not\n"
 "till forced to it by Ahab's iciness did he allude to his one yet\n"
 "missing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old, whose father with the\n"
 "earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer's paternal love,\n"
 "had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a\n"
 "vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race. Nor does it\n"
 "unfrequently occur, that Nantucket captains will send a son of such\n"
 "tender age away from them, for a protracted three or four years'\n"
 "voyage in some other ship than their own; so that their first\n"
 "knowledge of a whaleman's career shall be unenervated by any chance\n"
 "display\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " of a father's natural but untimely partiality, or undue\n"
 "apprehensiveness and concern.  Meantime, now the stranger was still\n"
 "beseeching his poor boon of Ahab; and Ahab still stood like an anvil,\n"
 "receiving every shock, but without the least quivering of his own.  \"I\n"
 "will not go,\" said the stranger, \"till you say aye to me. Do to me as\n"
 "you would have me do to you in the like case. For you too have a boy,\n"
 "Captain Ahab - though but a child, and nestling safely at home now - a\n"
 "child of your old age too - Yes, yes, you relent; I see it - run, run,\n"
 "men, now, and stand by to square in the yards.\"  \"Avast,\" cried Ahab -\n"
 "\"touch not a rope-yarn\"; then in a voice that prolongingly moulded\n"
 "every word - \"Captain Gardiner, I will not do it. Even now I lose\n"
 "time.  Good bye, good bye. God bless ye, man, and may I forgive\n"
 "myself, but I must go.  Mr. Starbuck, look at the binnacle watch, and\n"
 "in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers:\n"
 "then brace forward again, and let the ship sail as before.\"  Hurriedly\n"
 "turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin, leaving the\n"
 "strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection\n"
 "of his so earnest suit. But starting from his enchantment, Gardiner\n"
 "silently hurried to the side; more fell than stepped into his boat,\n"
 "and returned to his ship.  Soon the two ships diverged their wakes;\n"
 "and long as the strange vessel was in view, she was seen to yaw hither\n"
 "and thither at every dark spot, however small, on the sea. This way\n"
 "and that her yards were swung round; starboard and larboard, she\n"
 "continued to tack; now she beat against a head sea; and again it\n"
 "pushed her before it; while all the while, her masts and yards were\n"
 "thickly clustered with men, as three tall cherry trees, when the boys\n"
 "are cherrying among the boughs.  But by her still halting course and\n"
 "winding, woful way, you plainly saw that this ship that so wept with\n"
 "spray, still remained without comfort. She was Rachel, weeping for her\n"
 "children, because they were not.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Ahab moving to go on deck; Pip catches him by the hand to\n"
 "follow.  \"Lad, lad, I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now. The\n"
 "hour is coming when Ahab would not scare thee from him, yet would not\n"
 "have thee by him. There is that in thee, poor lad, which I feel too\n"
 "curing to my malady. Like cures like; and for this hunt, my malady\n"
 "becomes my most desired health. Do thou abide below here, where they\n"
 "shall serve thee, as if thou wert the captain. Aye, lad, thou shalt\n"
 "sit here in my own screwed chair; another screw to it, thou must be.\"\n"
 "\"No, no, no! ye have not a whole body, Sir; do ye but use poor me for\n"
 "your one lost leg; only tread upon me, Sir; I ask no more, so I remain\n"
 "a part of ye.\"  \"Oh! spite of million villains, this makes me a bigot\n"
 "in the fadeless fidelity of man! - and a black! and crazy! - but\n"
 "methinks like-cures-like applies to him too; he grows so sane again.\"\n"
 "\"They tell me, Sir, that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip, whose\n"
 "drowned bones now show white, for all the blackness of his living\n"
 "skin. But I will never desert ye, Sir, as Stubb did him. Sir, I must\n"
 "go with ye.\"  \"If thou speakest thus to me much more, Ahab's purpose\n"
 "keels up in him. I tell thee no; it cannot be.\"  \"Oh good master,\n"
 "master, master!\"  \"Weep so, and I will murder thee! have a care, for\n"
 "Ahab too is mad. Listen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon\n"
 "the deck, and still know that I am there. And now I quit thee. Thy\n"
 "hand! - Met! True art thou, lad, as the circumference to its\n"
 "centre. So: God for ever bless thee; and if it come to that, - God for\n"
 "ever save thee, let what will befall.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Ahab goes; Pip steps one step forward.  \"Here he this instant\n"
 "stood; I stand in his air, - but I'm alone. Now were even poor Pip\n"
 "here I could endure it, but he's missing. Pip! Pip! Ding, dong, ding!\n"
 "Who's seen Pip? He must be up here; let's try the door. What? neither\n"
 "lock, nor bolt, nor bar; and yet there's no opening it. It must be the\n"
 "spell; he told me to stay here: Aye, and told me this screwed chair\n"
 "was mine. Here, then, I'll seat me, against the transom, in the ship's\n"
 "full middle, all her keel and her three masts before me. Here, our old\n"
 "sailors say, in their black seventy-fours great admirals sometimes sit\n"
 "at table, and lord it over rows of captains and lieutenants. Ha!\n"
 "what's this? epaulets! epaulets! the epaulets all come crowding! Pass\n"
 "round the decanters; glad to see ye; fill up, monsieurs! What an odd\n"
 "feeling, now, when a black boy's host to white men with gold lace upon\n"
 "their coats! - Monsieurs, have ye seen one Pip? - a little negro lad,\n"
 "five feet high, hang-dog look, and cowardly! Jumped from a whale-boat\n"
 "once; - seen him? No! Well then, fill up again, captains, and let's\n"
 "drink shame upon all cowards! I name no names. Shame upon them! Put\n"
 "one foot upon the table. Shame upon all cowards. - Hist! above there,\n"
 "I hear ivory - Oh, master, master! I am indeed down-hearted when you\n"
 "walk over me. But here I'll stay, though this stern strikes rocks; and\n"
 "they bulge through; and oysters come to join me.\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " And now that at the proper time and place, after so long and\n"
 "wide a preliminary cruise, Ahab, - all other whaling waters swept -\n"
 "seemed to have chased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more\n"
 "securely there; now, that he found himself hard by the very latitude\n"
 "and longitude where his tormenting wound\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " had been inflicted; now that a vessel had been spoken which\n"
 "on the very day preceding had actually encountered Moby Dick; - and\n"
 "now that all his successive meetings with various ships contrastingly\n"
 "concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which the white whale\n"
 "tore his hunters, whether sinning or sinned against; now it was that\n"
 "there lurked a something in the old man's eyes, which it was hardly\n"
 "sufferable for feeble souls to see. As the unsetting polar star, which\n"
 "through the livelong, arctic, six months' night sustains its piercing,\n"
 "steady, central gaze; so Ahab's purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon\n"
 "the constant midnight of the gloomy crew. It domineered above them so,\n"
 "that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings, fears, were fain to hide\n"
 "beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf.  In\n"
 "this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,\n"
 "vanished.  Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more\n"
 "strove to check one.  Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed\n"
 "ground to finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped\n"
 "mortar of Ahab's iron soul. like machines, they dumbly moved about the\n"
 "deck, ever conscious that the old man's despot eye was on them.  But\n"
 "did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours; when he\n"
 "thought no glance but one was on him; then you would have seen that\n"
 "even as Ahab's eyes so awed the crew's, the inscrutable Parsee's\n"
 "glance awed his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times\n"
 "affected it. Such an added, gliding strangeness began to invest the\n"
 "thin Fedallah now; such ceaseless shudderings shook him; that the men\n"
 "looked dubious at him; half uncertain, as it seemed, whether indeed he\n"
 "were a mortal substance, or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck\n"
 "by some unseen being's body. And that shadow was always hovering\n"
 "there. For not by night, even, had Fedallah ever certainly been known\n"
 "to slumber, or go below. He would stand still for hours: but never sat\n"
 "or leaned; his wan but wondrous eyes did plainly say - We two watchmen\n"
 "never rest.  Now, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now\n"
 "step up the deck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his\n"
 "pivot-hole, or exactly pacing the planks between two\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " undeviating limits, - the main-mast and the mizen; or else\n"
 "they saw him standing in the cabin-scuttle, - his living foot advanced\n"
 "upon the deck, as if to step; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes;\n"
 "so that however motionless he stood, however the days and nights were\n"
 "added on, that he had not swung in his hammock; yet hidden beneath\n"
 "that slouching hat, they could never tell unerringly whether, for all\n"
 "this, his eyes were really closed at times; or whether he was still\n"
 "intently scanning them; no matter, though he stood so in the scuttle\n"
 "for a whole hour on the stretch, and the unheeded night-damp gathered\n"
 "in beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat. The clothes that\n"
 "the night had wet, the next day's sunshine dried upon him; and so, day\n"
 "after day, and night after night; he went no more beneath the planks;\n"
 "whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for.  He ate in\n"
 "the same open air; that is, his two only meals, - breakfast and\n"
 "dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly\n"
 "grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still\n"
 "grow idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper verdure. But\n"
 "though his whole life was now become one watch on deck; and though the\n"
 "Parsee's mystic watch was without intermission as his own; yet these\n"
 "two never seemed to speak - one man to the other - unless at long\n"
 "intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary. Though\n"
 "such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain; openly, and to\n"
 "the awe-struck crew, they seemed pole-like asunder. If by day they\n"
 "chanced to speak one word; by night, dumb men were both, so far as\n"
 "concerned the slightest verbal interchange. At times, for longest\n"
 "hours, without a single hail, they stood far parted in the starlight;\n"
 "Ahab in his scuttle, the Parsee by the mainmast; but still fixedly\n"
 "gazing upon each other; as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown\n"
 "shadow, in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned substance.  And yet, somehow,\n"
 "did Ahab - in his own proper self, as daily, hourly, and every\n"
 "instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates, - Ahab seemed an\n"
 "independent lord; the Parsee but his slave. Still again both seemed\n"
 "yoked together, and an unseen\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " tyrant driving them; the lean shade siding the solid rib. For\n"
 "be this Parsee what he may, all rib and keel was solid Ahab.  At the\n"
 "first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was heard from\n"
 "aft - \"Man the mast-heads!\" - and all through the day, till after\n"
 "sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at the striking\n"
 "of the helmsman's bell, was heard - \"What d'ye see? - sharp! sharp!\"\n"
 "But when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the children-\n"
 "seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the monomaniac old man\n"
 "seemed distrustful of his crew's fidelity; at least, of nearly all\n"
 "except the Pagan harpooneers; he seemed to doubt, even, whether Stubb\n"
 "and Flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought. But if\n"
 "these suspicions were really his, he sagaciously refrained from\n"
 "verbally expressing them, however his actions might seem to hint them.\n"
 "\"I will have the first sight of the whale myself,\" - he said. \"Aye!\n"
 "Ahab must have the doubloon!\" and with his own hands he rigged a nest\n"
 "of basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved\n"
 "block, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of\n"
 "the downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a\n"
 "pin for the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail. This done,\n"
 "with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked\n"
 "round upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his\n"
 "glance long upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah;\n"
 "and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate, said, -\n"
 "\"Take the rope, Sir - I give it into thy hands, Starbuck.\" Then\n"
 "arranging his person in the basket, he gave the word for them to hoist\n"
 "him to his perch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last;\n"
 "and afterwards stood near it. And thus, with one hand clinging round\n"
 "the royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles, -\n"
 "ahead, astern, this side, and that, - within the wide expanded circle\n"
 "commanded at so great a height.  When in working with his hands at\n"
 "some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging, which chances to\n"
 "afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot, and\n"
 "sustained there by\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the rope; under these circumstances, its fastened end on deck\n"
 "is always given in strict charge to some one man who has the special\n"
 "watch of it. Because in such a wilderness of running rigging, whose\n"
 "various different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly\n"
 "discerned by what is seen of them at the deck; and when the deck-ends\n"
 "of these ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the\n"
 "fastenings, it would be but a natural fatality, if, unprovided with a\n"
 "constant watchman, the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of\n"
 "the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea. So Ahab's\n"
 "proceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only strange thing\n"
 "about them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one only man who\n"
 "had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree\n"
 "approaching to decision - one of those too, whose faithfulness on the\n"
 "look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat; - it was strange, that this\n"
 "was the very man he should select for his watchman; freely giving his\n"
 "whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person's hands.  Now, the\n"
 "first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten minutes;\n"
 "one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly\n"
 "incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these\n"
 "latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his\n"
 "head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings. Then it darted a\n"
 "thousand feet straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards, and\n"
 "went eddying again round his head.  But with his gaze fixed upon the\n"
 "dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird; nor,\n"
 "indeed, would any one else have marked it much, it being no uncommon\n"
 "circumstance; only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some\n"
 "sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight.  \"Your hat, your hat,\n"
 "Sir!\" suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who being posted at the\n"
 "mizen-mast- head, stood directly behind Ahab, though somewhat lower\n"
 "than his level, and with a deep gulf of air dividing them.  But\n"
 "already the sable wing was before the old man's eyes; the long hooked\n"
 "bill at his head: with a scream, the black hawk darted away with his\n"
 "prize.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin's head, removing his cap\n"
 "to replace it, and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin\n"
 "would be king of Rome. But only by the replacing of the cap was that\n"
 "omen accounted good. Ahab's hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew\n"
 "on and on with it; far in advance of the prow: and at last\n"
 "disappeared; while from the point of that disappearance, a minute\n"
 "black spot was dimly discerned, falling from that vast height into the\n"
 "sea.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went\n"
 "by; the life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most\n"
 "miserably misnamed the Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all\n"
 "eyes were fixed upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some\n"
 "whaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine\n"
 "feet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.  Upon\n"
 "the stranger's shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and some\n"
 "few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you now\n"
 "saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled,\n"
 "half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.  \"Hast seen the\n"
 "White Whale?\"  \"Look!\" replied the hollow- cheeked captain from his\n"
 "taffrail; and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck.  \"Hast killed\n"
 "him?\"  \"The harpoon is not yet forged that will ever do that,\"\n"
 "answered the other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck,\n"
 "whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing\n"
 "together.  \"Not forged!\" and snatching Perth's levelled iron from the\n"
 "crotch, Ahab held it out, exclaiming - \"Look ye, Nantucketer;\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " here in this hand I hold his death! Tempered in blood, and\n"
 "tempered by lightning are these barbs; and I swear to temper them\n"
 "triply in that hot place behind the fin, where the white whale most\n"
 "feels his accursed life!\"  \"Then God keep thee, old man - see'st thou\n"
 "that\" - pointing to the hammock - \"I bury but one of five stout men,\n"
 "who were alive only yesterday; but were dead ere night. Only that one\n"
 "I bury; the rest were buried before they died; you sail upon their\n"
 "tomb.\" Then turning to his crew - \"Are ye ready there? place the plank\n"
 "then on the rail, and lift the body; so, then - Oh! God\" - advancing\n"
 "towards the hammock with uplifted hands - may the resurrection and the\n"
 "life - \" \"Brace forward! Up helm!\" cried Ahab like lightning to his\n"
 "men.  But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape\n"
 "the sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the\n"
 "sea; not so quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might\n"
 "have sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism.  As Ahab now\n"
 "glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy hanging at the\n"
 "Pequod's stern came into conspicuous relief.  \"Ha! yonder! look\n"
 "yonder, men!\" cried a foreboding voice in her wake. \"In vain, oh, ye\n"
 "strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us your taffrail to show\n"
 "us your coffin!\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " It was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea\n"
 "were hardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive\n"
 "air was transparently pure and soft, with a woman's look, and the\n"
 "robust and man-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as\n"
 "Samson's chest in his sleep.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of\n"
 "small, unspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the\n"
 "feminine air; but to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless\n"
 "blue, rushed mighty leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were\n"
 "the strong, troubled, murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.  But\n"
 "though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and\n"
 "shadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it\n"
 "were, that distinguished them.  Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the\n"
 "sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea; even\n"
 "as bride to groom. And at the girdling line of the horizon, a soft and\n"
 "tremulous motion - most seen here at the equator - denoted the fond,\n"
 "throbbing trust, the loving alarms, with which the poor bride gave her\n"
 "bosom away.  Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles;\n"
 "haggardly firm and unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still\n"
 "glow in the ashes of ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth in the\n"
 "clearness of the morn; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the\n"
 "fair girl's forehead of heaven.  Oh, immortal infancy, and innocency\n"
 "of the azure! Invisible winged creatures that frolic all round us!\n"
 "Sweet childhood of air and sky! how oblivious were ye of old Ahab's\n"
 "close-coiled woe! But so have I seen little Miriam and Martha,\n"
 "laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around their old sire; sporting\n"
 "with the circle of singed locks which grew on the marge of that\n"
 "burnt-out crater of his brain.  Slowly crossing the deck from the\n"
 "scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side, and watched how his shadow in the\n"
 "water sank and sank to his gaze, the more and the more that he strove\n"
 "to pierce the profundity. But the lovely aromas in that enchanted air\n"
 "did at last seem to dispel, for a moment, the cankerous thing in his\n"
 "soul. That glad, happy air, that winsome sky, did at last stroke and\n"
 "caress him; the step-mother world, so long cruel - forbidding - now\n"
 "threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck, and did seem to\n"
 "joyously sob over him, as if over one, that however wilful and erring,\n"
 "she could yet find it in her\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " heart to save and to bless. From beneath his slouched hat\n"
 "Ahab dropped a tear into the sea; nor did all the pacific contain such\n"
 "wealth as that one wee drop.  Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how\n"
 "he heavily leaned over the side; and he seemed to hear in his own true\n"
 "heart the measureless sobbing that stole out of the centre of the\n"
 "serenity around. Careful not to touch him, or be noticed by him, he\n"
 "yet drew near to him, and stood there.  Ahab turned.  \"Starbuck!\"\n"
 "\"Sir.\"  \"Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking\n"
 "sky. On such a day - very much such a sweetness as this - I struck my\n"
 "first whale - a boy-harpooneer of eighteen! Forty - forty - forty\n"
 "years ago! - ago! Forty years of continual whaling! forty years of\n"
 "privation, and peril, and storm-time! forty years on the pitiless sea!\n"
 "for forty years has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land, for forty years\n"
 "to make war on the horrors of the deep! Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of\n"
 "those forty years I have not spent three ashore. When I think of this\n"
 "life I have led; the desolation of solitude it has been; the masoned,\n"
 "walled-town of a Captain's exclusiveness, which admits but small\n"
 "entrance to any sympathy from the green country without - oh,\n"
 "weariness! heaviness! Guinea-coast slavery of solitary command! - when\n"
 "I think of all this; only half-suspected, not so keenly known to me\n"
 "before - and how for forty years I have fed upon dry salted fare - fit\n"
 "emblem of the dry nourishment of my soul - when the poorest landsman\n"
 "has had fresh fruit to his daily hand, and broken the world's fresh\n"
 "bread to my mouldy crusts - away, whole oceans away, from that young\n"
 "girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and sailed for Cape Horn the next day,\n"
 "leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow - wife? wife? - rather a\n"
 "widow with her husband alive! Aye, I widowed that poor girl when I\n"
 "married her, Starbuck; and then, the madness, the frenzy, the boiling\n"
 "blood and the smoking brow, with which, for a thousand lowerings old\n"
 "Ahab has furiously, foamingly chased his prey - more a demon than a\n"
 "man! - aye, aye! what a forty years' fool - fool - old fool, has old\n"
 "Ahab been! Why this strife of the chase? why weary,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance?\n"
 "how the richer or better is Ahab now? Behold. Oh, Starbuck! is it not\n"
 "hard, that with this weary load I bear, one poor leg should have been\n"
 "snatched from under me? Here, brush this old hair aside; it blinds me,\n"
 "that I seem to weep. Locks so grey did never grow but from out some\n"
 "ashes! But do I look very old, so very, very old, Starbuck? I feel\n"
 "deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as though I were Adam, staggering\n"
 "beneath the piled centuries since Paradise. God! God! God! - crack my\n"
 "heart! - stave my brain! - mockery! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of\n"
 "grey hairs, have I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus\n"
 "intolerably old? Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into\n"
 "a human eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to\n"
 "gaze upon God. By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is\n"
 "the magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. No, no;\n"
 "stay on board, on board! - lower not when I do; when branded Ahab\n"
 "gives chase to Moby Dick. That hazard shall not be thine.  No, no! not\n"
 "with the far away home I see in that eye!\"  \"Oh, my Captain! my\n"
 "Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all! why should any one\n"
 "give chase to that hated fish! Away with me! let us fly these deadly\n"
 "waters! let us home! Wife and child, too, are Starbuck's - wife and\n"
 "child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow youth; even as thine,\n"
 "Sir, are the wife and child of thy loving, longing, paternal old age!\n"
 "Away! let us away! - this instant let me alter the course! How\n"
 "cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would we bowl on our way to\n"
 "see old Nantucket again! I think, Sir, they have some such mild blue\n"
 "days, even as this, in Nantucket.\"  \"They have, they have. I have seen\n"
 "them - some summer days in the morning. About this time - yes, it is\n"
 "his noon nap now - the boy vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his\n"
 "mother tells him of me, of cannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the\n"
 "deep, but will yet come back to dance him again.\"  \"Tis my Mary, my\n"
 "Mary herself! She promised that my boy, every morning, should be\n"
 "carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his father's sail!\n"
 "Yes, yes! no more! it is done! we head for Nantucket! Come, my\n"
 "Captain, study out the course,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " and let us away! See, see! the boy's face from the window!\n"
 "the boy's hand on the hill!\"  But Ahab's glance was averted; like a\n"
 "blighted fruit tree he shook, and cast his last, cindered apple to the\n"
 "soil.\"  \"What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is\n"
 "it; what cozzening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless\n"
 "emperor commands me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I\n"
 "so keep pushing, and crowding, and jamming myself on all the time;\n"
 "recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper, natural heart,\n"
 "I durst not so much as dare? Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, or who, that\n"
 "lifts this arm? But if the great sun move not of himself; but is as an\n"
 "errand-boy in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some\n"
 "invisible power; how then can this one small heart beat; this one\n"
 "small brain think thoughts; unless God does that beating, does that\n"
 "thinking, does that living, and not I. By heaven, man, we are turned\n"
 "round and round in this world, like yonder windlass, and Fate is the\n"
 "handspike. And all the time, lo! that smiling sky, and this unsounded\n"
 "sea! Look! see yon Albicore! who put it into him to chase and fang\n"
 "that flying-fish? Where do murderers go, man! Who's to doom, when the\n"
 "judge himself is dragged to the bar? But it is a mild, mild wind, and\n"
 "a mild looking sky; and the air smells now, as if it blew from a\n"
 "far-away meadow; they have been making hay somewhere under the slopes\n"
 "of the Andes, Starbuck, and the mowers are sleeping among the new-\n"
 "mown hay. Sleeping? Aye, toil we how we may, we all sleep at last on\n"
 "the field. Sleep? Aye, and rust amid greenness; as last year's scythes\n"
 "flung down, and left in the half-cut swaths - Starbuck!\"  But blanched\n"
 "to a corpse's hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away.  Ahab\n"
 "crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at two\n"
 "reflected, fixed eyes in the water there. Fedallah was motionlessly\n"
 "leaning over the same rail.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " That night, in the mid-watch, when the old man - as his wont\n"
 "at intervals - stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and\n"
 "went to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely,\n"
 "snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship's dog will, in drawing\n"
 "nigh to some barbarous isle. He declared that a whale must be\n"
 "near. Soon that peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given\n"
 "forth by the living sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor\n"
 "was any mariner surprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then\n"
 "the dog-vane, and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as\n"
 "nearly as possible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ship's course to be\n"
 "slightly altered, and the sail to be shortened.  The acute policy\n"
 "dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at daybreak, by\n"
 "the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead,\n"
 "smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering\n"
 "it, the polished metallic-like marks of some swift tide- rip, at the\n"
 "mouth of a deep, rapid stream.  \"Man the mast-heads! Call all hands!\"\n"
 "Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the\n"
 "forecastle deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps\n"
 "that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did\n"
 "they appear with their clothes in their hands.  \"What d'ye see?\" cried\n"
 "Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.  \"Nothing, nothing, Sir!\" was\n"
 "the sound hailing down in reply.  \"T'gallant sails! - stunsails! alow\n"
 "and aloft, and on both sides!\"  All sail being set, he now cast loose\n"
 "the life-line, reserved for swaying him to the main royal-mast head;\n"
 "and in a few moments they were hoisting him thither, when, while but\n"
 "two thirds of the way aloft, and while peering ahead through the\n"
 "horizontal vacancy between the main-top- sail and top-gallant-sail,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " he raised a gull-like cry in the air, \"There she blows! -\n"
 "there she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! It is Moby Dick!\"  Fired by\n"
 "the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three look-outs,\n"
 "the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they\n"
 "had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final perch, some\n"
 "feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just beneath him on\n"
 "the cap of the top-gallant mast, so that the Indian's head was almost\n"
 "on a level with Ahab's heel. From this height the whale was now seen\n"
 "some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing his high\n"
 "sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent spout into the\n"
 "air. To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they\n"
 "had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.\n"
 "\"And did none of ye see it before?\" cried Ahab, hailing the perched\n"
 "men all around him.\"  \"I saw him almost that same instant, Sir, that\n"
 "Captain Ahab did, and I cried out,\" said Tashtego.  \"Not the same\n"
 "instant; not the same - no, the doubloon is mine, Fate reserved the\n"
 "doubloon for me. I only; none of ye could have raised the White Whale\n"
 "first.  There she blows! there she blows! - there she blows! There\n"
 "again! - there again!  he cried, in long-drawn, lingering, methodic\n"
 "tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale's visible\n"
 "jets. \"He's going to sound! In stunsails!  Down top- gallant-sails!\n"
 "Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay on board, and keep\n"
 "the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So; steady, man, steady!\n"
 "There go flukes! No, no; only black water! All ready the boats there?\n"
 "Stand by, stand by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck; lower, lower, - quick,\n"
 "quicker!\" and he slid through the air to the deck.  \"He is heading\n"
 "straight to leeward, Sir,\" cried Stubb, \"right away from us; cannot\n"
 "have seen the ship yet.\"  \"Be dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard\n"
 "down the helm! - brace up! Shiver her!  - shiver her! So; well that!\n"
 "Boats, boats!\"  Soon all the boats but Starbuck's were dropped; all\n"
 "the boat-sails set - all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness,\n"
 "shooting to leeward; and Ahab heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " lit up Fedallah's sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his\n"
 "mouth.  Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through\n"
 "the sea; but only slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the\n"
 "ocean grew still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves;\n"
 "seemed a noon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the breathless\n"
 "hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire\n"
 "dazzling hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an\n"
 "isolated thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of finest,\n"
 "fleecy, greenish foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the\n"
 "slightly projecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft\n"
 "Turkish- rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his\n"
 "broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the\n"
 "shade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into\n"
 "the moving valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright\n"
 "bubbles arose and danced by his side. But these were broken again by\n"
 "the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea,\n"
 "alternate with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising\n"
 "from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a\n"
 "recent lance projected from the white whale's back; and at intervals\n"
 "one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming\n"
 "like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole,\n"
 "the long tail feathers streaming like pennons.  A gentle joyousness -\n"
 "a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested the gliding\n"
 "whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with ravished Europa\n"
 "clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering eyes sideways\n"
 "intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness, rippling\n"
 "straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that great\n"
 "majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so\n"
 "divinely swam.  On each soft side - coincident with the parted swell,\n"
 "that but once leaving him, then flowed so wide away - on each bright\n"
 "side, the whale shed off enticings. No wonder there had been some\n"
 "among the hunters who namelessly transported and allured by all this\n"
 "serenity, had ventured to assail it; but had fatally\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " found that quietude but the vesture of tornadoes. Yet calm,\n"
 "enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all who for the first\n"
 "time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way thou may'st have\n"
 "bejuggled and destroyed before.  And thus, through the serene\n"
 "tranquillities of the tropical sea, among waves whose hand-clappings\n"
 "were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby Dick moved on, still\n"
 "withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged trunk,\n"
 "entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw. But soon the fore\n"
 "part of him slowly rose from the water; for an instant his whole\n"
 "marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia's Natural Bridge,\n"
 "and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air, the grand god\n"
 "revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight.  Hoveringly halting,\n"
 "and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls longingly lingered over\n"
 "the agitated pool that he left.  With oars apeak, and paddles down,\n"
 "the sheets of their sails adrift, the three boats now stilly floated,\n"
 "awaiting Moby Dick's reappearance.  \"An hour,\" said Ahab, standing\n"
 "rooted in his boat's stern; and he gazed beyond the whale's place,\n"
 "towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing vacancies to leeward. It\n"
 "was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed whirling round in his\n"
 "head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze now freshened; the sea\n"
 "began to swell.  \"The birds! - the birds!\" cried Tashtego.  In long\n"
 "Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were now all\n"
 "flying towards Ahab's boat; and when within a few yards began\n"
 "fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with\n"
 "joyous, expectant cries. Their vision was keener than man's; Ahab\n"
 "could discover no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and\n"
 "down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger\n"
 "than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying\n"
 "as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two\n"
 "long crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the\n"
 "undiscoverable bottom. It was Moby Dick's open mouth and scrolled jaw;\n"
 "his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the\n"
 "sea. The glittering mouth yawned beneath\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the boat like an open-doored marble tomb; and giving one\n"
 "side-long sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside\n"
 "from this tremendous apparition.  Then, calling upon Fedallah to\n"
 "change places with him, went forward to the bows, and seizing Perth's\n"
 "harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.\n"
 "Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,\n"
 "its bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale's head while yet\n"
 "under water. But as if perceiving this strategem, moby dick, with that\n"
 "malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted\n"
 "himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head\n"
 "lengthwise beneath the boat.  Through and through; through every plank\n"
 "and each rib, it thrilled for an instant, the whale obliquely lying on\n"
 "his back, in the manner of a biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking\n"
 "its bows full within his mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled\n"
 "lower jaw curled high up into the open air, and one of the teeth\n"
 "caught in a row-lock. The bluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw\n"
 "was within six inches of Ahab's head, and reached higher than that. In\n"
 "this attitude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly\n"
 "cruel cat her mouse. With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and\n"
 "crossed his arms; but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each\n"
 "other's heads to gain the uttermost stern.  And now, while both\n"
 "elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the whale dallied with\n"
 "the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his body being\n"
 "submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from the bows,\n"
 "for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while the\n"
 "other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis impossible\n"
 "to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with this\n"
 "tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and\n"
 "helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized\n"
 "the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it\n"
 "from its gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from\n"
 "him; the frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws,\n"
 "like an enormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely\n"
 "in twain, and locked themselves fast again in\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks. These\n"
 "floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern-wreck\n"
 "clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast to the oars to\n"
 "lash them across.  At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet\n"
 "snapped, Ahab, the first to perceive the whale's intent, by the crafty\n"
 "upraising of his head, a movement that loosed his hold for the time;\n"
 "at that moment his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out\n"
 "of the bite. But only slipping further into the whale's mouth, and\n"
 "tilting over sideways as it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold\n"
 "on the jaw; spilled him out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he\n"
 "fell flat-faced upon the sea.  Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey,\n"
 "Moby Dick now lay at a little distance, vertically thrusting his\n"
 "oblong white head up and down in the billows; and at the same time\n"
 "slowly revolving his whole spindled body; so that when his vast\n"
 "wrinkled forehead rose - some twenty or more feet out of the water -\n"
 "the now rising swells, with all their confluent waves, dazzlingly\n"
 "broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered spray still\n"
 "higher into the air. So, in a gale, the but half- baffled Channel\n"
 "billows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone, triumphantly to\n"
 "overleap its summit with their scud.  But soon resuming his horizontal\n"
 "attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round and round the wrecked crew;\n"
 "sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake, as if lashing\n"
 "himself up to still another and more deadly assault. The sight of the\n"
 "splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the blood of grapes and\n"
 "mulberries cast before Antiochus's elephants in the book of\n"
 "Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale's\n"
 "insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim, - though he could\n"
 "still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that;\n"
 "helpless Ahab's head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least\n"
 "chance shock might burst. From the boat's fragmentary\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " stern, Fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him; the clinging\n"
 "crew, at the other drifting end, could not succor him; more than\n"
 "enough was it for them to look to themselves. For so revolvingly\n"
 "appalling was the White Whale's aspect, and so planetarily swift the\n"
 "ever-contracting circles he made, that he seemed horizontally swooping\n"
 "upon them. And though the other boats, unharmed, still hovered hard\n"
 "by; still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike, lest that\n"
 "should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized\n"
 "castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that case could they themselves hope\n"
 "to escape. With straining eyes, then, they remained on the outer edge\n"
 "of the direful zone, whose centre had now become the old man's head.\n"
 "Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the\n"
 "ship's mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the\n"
 "scene; and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her; - \"Sail\n"
 "on the\" - but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick,\n"
 "and whelmed him for the time. But struggling out of it again, and\n"
 "chancing to rise on a towering crest, he shouted, - \"Sail on the\n"
 "whale! - Drive him off!\"  The Pequod's prows were pointed; and\n"
 "breaking up the charmed circle, she effectually parted the white whale\n"
 "from his victim. As he sullenly swam off, the boats flew to the\n"
 "rescue.  Dragged into Stubb's boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the\n"
 "white brine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab's bodily\n"
 "strength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body's doom: for\n"
 "a time, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb's boat, like one\n"
 "trodden under foot of herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails\n"
 "came from him, as desolate sounds from out ravines.  But this\n"
 "intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more\n"
 "abbreviate it. In an instant's compass, great hearts sometimes\n"
 "condense to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly\n"
 "diffused through feebler men's whole lives. And so, such hearts,\n"
 "though summary in each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it, in\n"
 "their life- time aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of\n"
 "instantaneous intensities; for even in their pointless centres, those\n"
 "noble natures contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " \"The harpoon,\" said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly\n"
 "leaning on one bended arm - \"is it safe?\"  \"Aye, Sir, for it was not\n"
 "darted; this is it,\" said Stubb, showing it.  \"Lay it before me; - any\n"
 "missing men?\"  \"One, two, three, four, five; - there were five oars,\n"
 "Sir, and here are five men.\"  \"That's good. - Help me, man; I wish to\n"
 "stand. So, so, I see him! there! there!  going to leeward still; what\n"
 "a leaping spout! Hands off from me! The eternal sap runs up in Ahab's\n"
 "bones again! Set the sail; out oars; the helm!\"  It is often the case\n"
 "that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked up by another boat,\n"
 "help to work that second boat; and the chase is thus continued with\n"
 "what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now. But the added\n"
 "power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale, for he\n"
 "seemed to have treble-banked his every fin; swimming with a velocity\n"
 "which plainly showed, that if now, under these circumstances, pushed\n"
 "on, the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged, if not a hopeless\n"
 "one; nor could any crew endure for so long a period, such an\n"
 "unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing barely tolerable\n"
 "only in some one brief vicissitude. The ship itself, then, as it\n"
 "sometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate means of\n"
 "overtaking the chase. Accordingly, the boats now made for her, and\n"
 "were soon swayed up to their cranes - the two parts of the wrecked\n"
 "boat having been previously secured by her - and then hoisting\n"
 "everything to her side, and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways\n"
 "outstretching it with stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an\n"
 "albatross; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby Dick. At\n"
 "the well known, methodic intervals, the whale's glittering spout was\n"
 "regularly announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be\n"
 "reported as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing\n"
 "the deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the\n"
 "allotted hour expired, his voice was heard. - \"Whose is the doubloon\n"
 "now? D'ye see him?\" and if the reply was, No, Sir! straightway he\n"
 "commanded them to lift him to his perch. In this way the day wore on;\n"
 "Ahab,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " now aloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the\n"
 "planks.  As he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the\n"
 "men aloft, or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one\n"
 "to a still greater breadth - thus to and fro pacing, beneath his\n"
 "slouched hat, at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had\n"
 "been dropped upon the quarter- deck, and lay there reversed; broken\n"
 "bow to shattered stern. At last he paused before it; and as in an\n"
 "already over-clouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail\n"
 "across, so over the old man's face there now stole some such added\n"
 "gloom as this.  Stubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not\n"
 "vainly, though, to evince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up\n"
 "a valiant place in his Captain's mind, he advanced, and eyeing the\n"
 "wreck exclaimed - \"The thistle the ass refused; it pricked his mouth\n"
 "too keenly, Sir; ha! ha!\"  \"What soulless thing is this that laughs\n"
 "before a wreck? Man, man! did I not know thee brave as fearless fire\n"
 "(and as mechanical) I could swear thou wert a poltroon. Groan nor\n"
 "laugh should be heard before a wreck.\"  \"Aye, Sir,\" said Starbuck\n"
 "drawing near, \"'tis a solemn sight; an omen, and an ill one.\"  \"Omen?\n"
 "omen? - the dictionary! If the gods think to speak outright to man,\n"
 "they will honorably speak outright; not shake their heads, and give an\n"
 "old wives' darkling hint. - Begone! Ye two are the opposite poles of\n"
 "one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck; and ye\n"
 "two are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the\n"
 "peopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors! Cold, cold - I shiver!\n"
 "- How now? Aloft there! D'ye see him? Sing out for every spout, though\n"
 "he spout ten times a second!\"  The day was nearly done; only the hem\n"
 "of his golden robe was rustling. Soon, it was almost dark, but the\n"
 "look-out men still remained unset.  \"Can't see the spout now, Sir; -\n"
 "too dark\" - cried a voice from the air.  How heading when last seen?\"\n"
 "\"As before, Sir, - straight to leeward.\"  \"Good! he will travel slower\n"
 "now 'tis night. Down royals and\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " top-gallant stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck. We must not run over\n"
 "him before morning; he's making a passage now, and may heave-to a\n"
 "while. Helm there! keep her full before the wind! - Aloft! come down!\n"
 "- Mr. Stubb, send a fresh hand to the fore-mast head, and see it\n"
 "manned till morning.\" - Then advancing towards the doubloon in the\n"
 "main-mast - \"Men, this gold is mine, for I earned it; but I shall let\n"
 "it abide here till the White Whale is dead; and then, whosoever of ye\n"
 "first raises him, upon the day he shall be killed, this gold is that\n"
 "man's; and if on that day I shall again raise him, then, ten times its\n"
 "sum shall be divided among all of ye! Away now! - the deck is thine,\n"
 "Sir.\"  And so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle,\n"
 "and slouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals\n"
 "rousing himself to see how the night wore on. This motion is peculiar\n"
 "to the sperm whale. It receives its designation (pitchpoling) from its\n"
 "being likened to that preliminary up-and-down poise of the\n"
 "whale-lance, in the exercise called pitchpoling, previously\n"
 "described. By this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively\n"
 "view whatever objects may be encircling him.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " At day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned\n"
 "afresh.  \"D'ye see him?\" cried Ahab, after allowing a little space for\n"
 "the light to spread.  \"See nothing, Sir.\"  \"Turn up all hands and make\n"
 "sail! he travels faster than I thought for; - the top-gallant sails! -\n"
 "aye, they should have been kept on her all night. But no matter - 'tis\n"
 "but resting for the rush.\"  Here be it said, that this pertinacious\n"
 "pursuit of one particular whale, continued through day into night, and\n"
 "through night into day, is a thing by no means unprecedented in the\n"
 "South sea fishery. For such is the wonderful skill, prescience of\n"
 "experience, and invincible confidence acquired by some great natural\n"
 "geniuses among the Nantucket commanders; that from the simple\n"
 "observation of a whale when last descried, they will,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " under certain given circumstances, pretty accurately foretell\n"
 "both the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time, while\n"
 "out of sight, as well as his probable rate of progression during that\n"
 "period. And, in these cases, somewhat as a pilot, when about losing\n"
 "sight of a coast, whose general trending he well knows, and which he\n"
 "desires shortly to return to again, but at some further point; like as\n"
 "this pilot stands by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the\n"
 "cape at present visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright the\n"
 "remote, unseen headland, eventually to be visited: so does the\n"
 "fisherman, at his compass, with the whale; for after being chased, and\n"
 "diligently marked, through several hours of daylight, then, when night\n"
 "obscures the fish, the creature's future wake through the darkness is\n"
 "almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the\n"
 "pilot's coast is to him. So that to this hunter's wondrous skill, the\n"
 "proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water, a wake, is to all\n"
 "desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land. And as\n"
 "the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known\n"
 "in its every pace, that, with watches in their hands, men time his\n"
 "rate as doctors that of a baby's pulse; and lightly say of it, the up\n"
 "train or the down train will reach such or such a spot, at such or\n"
 "such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions when these\n"
 "Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep, according to the\n"
 "observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so many hours\n"
 "hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have about\n"
 "reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to render\n"
 "this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the sea must\n"
 "be the whaleman's allies; for of what present avail to the becalmed or\n"
 "windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is exactly\n"
 "ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port? Inferable from these\n"
 "statements, are many collateral subtile matters touching the chase of\n"
 "whales.  The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a\n"
 "cannon-ball, missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level\n"
 "field.  \"By salt and hemp!\" cried Stubb, \"but this swift motion of the\n"
 "deck creeps up one's legs and tingles at the heart. This\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " ship and I are two brave fellows! - Ha! ha! Some one take me\n"
 "up, and launch me, spine-wise, on the sea, - for by live-oaks! my\n"
 "spine's a keel. Ha, ha! we go the gait that leaves no dust behind!\"\n"
 "\"There she blows - she blows! - she blows! - right ahead!\" was now the\n"
 "mast-head cry.  \"Aye, aye!\" cried Stubb. \"I knew it - ye can't escape\n"
 "- blow on and split your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is\n"
 "after ye! blow your trump - blister your lungs! - Ahab will dam off\n"
 "your blood, as a miller shuts his water-gate upon the stream!\"  And\n"
 "Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew. The frenzies of\n"
 "the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine\n"
 "worked anew.  Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might\n"
 "have felt before; these were not only now kept out of sight through\n"
 "the growing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides\n"
 "routed, as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding\n"
 "bison. The hand of Fate had snatched all their souls; and by the\n"
 "stirring perils of the previous day; the rack of the past night's\n"
 "suspense; the fixed, unfearing, blind, reckless way in which their\n"
 "wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark; by all these things,\n"
 "their hearts were bowled along. The wind that made great bellies of\n"
 "their sails, and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as\n"
 "irresistible; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so\n"
 "enslaved them to the race.  They were one man, not thirty. For as the\n"
 "one ship that held them all; though it was put together of all\n"
 "contrasting things - oak, and maple, and pine wood; iron, and pitch,\n"
 "and hemp - yet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull,\n"
 "which shot on its way, both balanced and directed by the long central\n"
 "keel; even so, all the individualities of the crew, this man's valor,\n"
 "that man's fear; guilt and guiltiness, all varieties were welded into\n"
 "oneness, and were all directed to that fatal goal which Ahab their one\n"
 "lord and keel did point to.  The rigging lived. The mast-heads, like\n"
 "the tops of tall palms, were outspreadingly tufted with arms and\n"
 "legs. Clinging to a spar with one hand, some reached forth the other\n"
 "with impatient wavings; others, shading their eyes from the vivid\n"
 "sunlight, sat\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " far out on the rocking yards; all the spars in full bearing\n"
 "of mortals, ready and ripe for their fate. Ah! how they still strove\n"
 "through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might\n"
 "destroy them!  \"Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?\" cried\n"
 "Ahab, when, after the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no\n"
 "more had been heard. \"Sway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not moby\n"
 "dick casts one odd jet that way, and then disappears.\"  It was even\n"
 "so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some other thing\n"
 "for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for hardly had\n"
 "Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on\n"
 "deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the air\n"
 "vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant\n"
 "halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as - much nearer to the\n"
 "ship than the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead -\n"
 "Moby Dick bodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent\n"
 "spoutings; not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his\n"
 "head, did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more\n"
 "wondrous phenomenon of breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from\n"
 "the furthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into\n"
 "the pure element of air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam,\n"
 "shows his place to the distance of seven miles and more. In those\n"
 "moments, the torn, enraged waves he shakes off, seem his mane; in some\n"
 "cases, this breaching is his act of defiance.  \"There she breaches!\n"
 "there she breaches!\" was the cry, as in his immeasureable bravadoes\n"
 "the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to Heaven. So suddenly seen\n"
 "in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved against the still bluer\n"
 "margin of the sky, the spray that he raised, for the moment,\n"
 "intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and stood there\n"
 "gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling intensity,\n"
 "to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.  \"Aye, breach\n"
 "your last to the sun, Moby Dick!\" cried Ahab, \"thy hour and thy\n"
 "harpoon are at hand! - Down! down all of ye, but one man at the\n"
 "fore. The boats!  - stand by!\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the\n"
 "men, like shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated back-\n"
 "stays and halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was\n"
 "dropped from his perch.  \"Lower away,\" he cried, so soon as he had\n"
 "reached his boat - a spare one, rigged the afternoon\n"
 "previous. \"Mr. Starbuck, the ship is thine - keep away from the boats,\n"
 "but keep near them. Lower, all!\"  As if to strike a quick terror into\n"
 "them, by this time being the first assailant himself, Moby Dick had\n"
 "turned, and was now coming for the three crews. Ahab's boat was\n"
 "central; and cheering his men, he told them he would take the whale\n"
 "head-and-head, - that is, pull straight up to his forehead, - a not\n"
 "uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit, such a course\n"
 "excludes the coming onset from the whale's sidelong vision. But ere\n"
 "that close limit was gained, and while yet all three boats were plain\n"
 "as the ship's three masts to his eye; the White Whale churning himself\n"
 "into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were, rushing among the\n"
 "boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered appalling battle on\n"
 "every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat,\n"
 "seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those\n"
 "boats were made. But skilfully manoeuvred, incessantly wheeling like\n"
 "trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while eluded him;\n"
 "though, at times, but by a plank's breadth; while all the time, Ahab's\n"
 "unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.  But at last\n"
 "in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed and\n"
 "recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three\n"
 "lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves,\n"
 "warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now\n"
 "for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more\n"
 "tremendous charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more\n"
 "line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again -\n"
 "hoping that way to disencumber it of some snarls - when lo! - a sight\n"
 "more savage than the embattled teeth of sharks!  Caught and twisted -\n"
 "corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons and lances, with\n"
 "all their bristling barbs and\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " points, came flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the\n"
 "bows of Ahab's boat.  Only one thing could be done. Seizing the boat-\n"
 "knife, he critically reached within - through - and then, without -\n"
 "the rays of steel; dragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to\n"
 "the bowsman, and then, twice sundering the rope near the chocks -\n"
 "dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast\n"
 "again. That instant, the White Whale made a sudden rush among the\n"
 "remaining tangles of the other lines; by so doing, irresistibly\n"
 "dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes;\n"
 "dashed them together like two rolling husks on a surf-beaten beach,\n"
 "and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a boiling\n"
 "maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the\n"
 "wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly\n"
 "stirred bowl of punch.  While the two crews were yet circling in the\n"
 "waters, reaching out after the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other\n"
 "floating furniture, while aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like\n"
 "an empty vial, twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws\n"
 "of sharks; and Stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him\n"
 "up; and while the old man's line - now parting - admitted of his\n"
 "pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he could; - in that wild\n"
 "simultaneousness of a thousand concreted perils, - Ahab's yet\n"
 "unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards Heaven by invisible wires, -\n"
 "as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly from the sea, the White Whale\n"
 "dashed his broad forehead against its bottom, and sent it, turning\n"
 "over and over, into the air; till it fell again - gunwale downwards -\n"
 "and Ahab and his men struggled out from under it, like seals from a\n"
 "seaside cave.  The first uprising momentum of the whale - modifying\n"
 "its direction as he struck the surface - involuntarily launched him\n"
 "along it, to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he\n"
 "had made; and with his back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly\n"
 "feeling with his flukes from side to side; and whenever a stray oar,\n"
 "bit of plank, the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin,\n"
 "his tail swiftly drew back, and came sideways smiting the sea. But\n"
 "soon, as if satisfied that his work for that time was done, he pushed\n"
 "his pleated forehead through the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines,\n"
 "continued his leeward way at a traveller's methodic pace.  As before,\n"
 "the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again came bearing\n"
 "down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the floating\n"
 "mariners, tubs, oars and whatever else could be caught at, and safely\n"
 "landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists, and ankles;\n"
 "livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances; inextricable\n"
 "intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these were there;\n"
 "but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one. As\n"
 "with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to\n"
 "his boat's broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy float; nor\n"
 "did it so exhaust him as the previous day's mishap.  But when he was\n"
 "helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as instead of\n"
 "standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of Starbuck,\n"
 "who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory leg had\n"
 "been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.  \"Aye, aye,\"\n"
 "Starbuck, 'tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he will; and\n"
 "would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.\"  \"The ferrule has not\n"
 "stood, Sir,\" said the carpenter, now coming up; \"I put good work into\n"
 "that leg.\"  \"But no bones broken, Sir, I hope,\" said Stubb with true\n"
 "concern.  \"Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb! - d'ye see it. -\n"
 "But even with a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no\n"
 "living bone of mine one jot more me, than this dead one that's\n"
 "lost. Nor white whale, nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old\n"
 "Ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being. Can any lead touch\n"
 "yonder floor, any mast scrape yonder roof? - Aloft there! which way?\"\n"
 "\n"
 "\"Dead to leeward, Sir.\"  \"Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship\n"
 "keepers! down the rest of the spare boats and rig them - Mr. Starbuck\n"
 "away, and muster the boat's crews.\"  \"Let me first help thee towards\n"
 "the bulwarks, Sir.\"  \"Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now!\n"
 "Accursed fate!\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " that the unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a\n"
 "craven mate!\"  \"Sir?\"  \"My body, man, not thee. Give me something for\n"
 "a cane - there, that shivered lance will do. Muster the men. Surely I\n"
 "have not seen him yet. By heaven it cannot be! - missing? - quick!\n"
 "call them all.\"  The old man's hinted thought was true. Upon mustering\n"
 "the company, the Parsee was not there.  \"The Parsee!\" cried Stubb -\n"
 "\"he must have been caught in - \" \"The black vomit wrench thee! - run\n"
 "all of ye above, alow, cabin, forecastle - find him - not gone - not\n"
 "gone!\"  But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the\n"
 "Parsee was nowhere to be found.  \"Aye, Sir,\" said Stubb - \"caught\n"
 "among the tangles of your line - I thought I saw him dragging under.\"\n"
 "\"My line! my line? Gone? - gone? What means that little word? - What\n"
 "death-knell rings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were the\n"
 "belfry. The harpoon, too! - toss over the litter there, - d'ye see it?\n"
 "- the forged iron, men, the white whale's - no, no, no, - blistered\n"
 "fool; this hand did dart it! - 'tis in the fish! - Aloft there! keep\n"
 "him nailed - quick! - all hands to the rigging of the boats - collect\n"
 "the oars - harpooneers! the irons, the irons! - hoist the royals\n"
 "higher - a pull on all the sheets! - helm there! steady, steady for\n"
 "your life!  I'll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe; yea and dive\n"
 "straight through it, but I'll slay him yet!\"  \"Great God! but for one\n"
 "single instant show thyself,\" cried Starbuck; \"never, never wilt thou\n"
 "capture him, old man - In Jesus' name no more of this, that's worse\n"
 "than devil's madness. Two days chased; twice stove to splinters; thy\n"
 "very leg once more snatched from under thee; thy evil shadow gone -\n"
 "all good angels mobbing thee with warnings: - what more wouldst thou\n"
 "have? - Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he swamps the\n"
 "last man? Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea? Shall\n"
 "we be towed by him to the infernal world?  Oh, oh, - Impiety and\n"
 "blasphemy to hunt him more!\"  \"Starbuck, of late I've felt strangely\n"
 "moved to thee; ever since that hour we both saw - thou know'st what,\n"
 "in one another's\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " eyes. But in this matter of the whale, be the front of thy\n"
 "face to me as the palm of this hand - a lipless, unfeatured\n"
 "blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab, man.  This whole act's immutably\n"
 "decreed. 'Twas rehearsed by thee an$ me a billion years before this\n"
 "ocean rolled. Fool! I am the Fates' lieutenant; I act under\n"
 "orders. Look thou, underling! that thou obeyest mine. - Stand round\n"
 "me, men. Ye see an old man cut down to the stump; leaning on a\n"
 "shivered lance; propped up on a lonely foot. 'Tis Ahab - his body's\n"
 "part; but Ahab's soul's a centipede, that moves upon a hundred legs. I\n"
 "feel strained, half stranded, as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in\n"
 "a gale; and I may look so. But ere I break, ye'll hear me crack; and\n"
 "till ye hear that, know that Ahab's hawser tows his purpose yet.\n"
 "Believe ye, men, in the things called omens? Then laugh aloud, and cry\n"
 "encore!  For ere they drown, drowning things will twice rise to the\n"
 "surface; then rise again, to sink for evermore. So with Moby Dick -\n"
 "two days he's floated - to- morrow will be the third. Aye, men, he'll\n"
 "rise once more, - but only to spout his last! D'ye feel brave men,\n"
 "brave?\"  \"As fearless fire,\" cried Stubb.  \"And as mechanical,\"\n"
 "muttered Ahab. Then as the men went forward, he muttered on: - \"The\n"
 "things called omens! And yesterday I talked the same to Starbuck\n"
 "there, concerning my broken boat. Oh! how valiantly I seek to drive\n"
 "out of others' hearts what's clinched so fast in mine! - The Parsee -\n"
 "the Parsee! - gone, gone? and he was to go before: - but still was to\n"
 "be seen again ere I could perish - How's that? - There's a riddle now\n"
 "might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line of\n"
 "judges: - like a hawk's beak it pecks my brain. I'll, I'll solve it,\n"
 "though!\"  When dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to\n"
 "leeward.  So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed\n"
 "nearly as on the previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the\n"
 "hum of the grindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men\n"
 "toiled by lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare\n"
 "boats and sharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow. Meantime, of\n"
 "the broken keel of Ahab's wrecked craft the carpenter made him another\n"
 "leg; while still as on the\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his scuttle;\n"
 "his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial;\n"
 "sat due eastward for the earliest sun.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once\n"
 "more the solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by\n"
 "crowds of the daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost\n"
 "every spar.  \"D'ye see him?\" cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in\n"
 "sight.  \"In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that's\n"
 "all. Helm there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going. What a\n"
 "lovely day again; were it a new-made world, and made for a\n"
 "summer-house to the angels, and this morning the first of its throwing\n"
 "open to them, a fairer day could not dawn upon that world.  Here's\n"
 "food for thought, had Ahab time to think; but Ahab never thinks; he\n"
 "only feels, feels, feels; that's tingling enough for mortal man! to\n"
 "think's audacity.  God only has that right and privilege. Thinking is,\n"
 "or ought to be, a coolness and a calmness; and our poor hearts throb,\n"
 "and our poor brains beat too much for that. And yet, I've sometimes\n"
 "thought my brain was very calm - frozen calm, this old skull cracks\n"
 "so, like a glass in which the contents turned to ice, and shiver\n"
 "it. And still this hair is growing now; this moment growing, and heat\n"
 "must breed it; but no, it's like that sort of common grass that will\n"
 "grow anywhere, between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice or in\n"
 "Vesuvius lava. How the wild winds blow it; they whip it about me as\n"
 "the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to. A\n"
 "vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors\n"
 "and cells, and wards of hospitals, and ventilated them, and now comes\n"
 "blowing hither as innocent as\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " fleeces. Out upon it! - it's tainted. Were I the wind, I'd\n"
 "blow no more on such a wicked, miserable world. I'd crawl somewhere to\n"
 "a cave, and slink there. And yet, 'tis a noble and heroic thing, the\n"
 "wind! who ever conquered it? In every fight it has the last and\n"
 "bitterest blow. Run tilting at it, and you but run through it. Ha! a\n"
 "coward wind that strikes stark naked men, but will not stand to\n"
 "receive a single blow. Even Ahab is a braver thing - a nobler thing\n"
 "that that. Would now the wind but had a body; but all the things that\n"
 "most exasperate and outrage mortal man, all these things are bodiless,\n"
 "but only bodiless as objects, not as agents. There's a most special, a\n"
 "most cunning, oh, a most malicious difference! And yet, I say again,\n"
 "and swear it now, that there's something all glorious and gracious in\n"
 "the wind. These warm Trade Winds, at least, that in the clear heavens\n"
 "blow straight on, in strong and steadfast, vigorous mildness; and veer\n"
 "not from their mark, however the baser currents of the sea may turn\n"
 "and tack, and mightiest Mississippies of the land swift and swerve\n"
 "about, uncertain where to go at last. And by the eternal Poles! these\n"
 "same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on; these Trades, or\n"
 "something like them - something so unchangeable, and full as strong,\n"
 "blow my keeled soul along! To it! Aloft there! What d'ye see?\"\n"
 "\"Nothing, Sir.\"  \"Nothing! and noon at hand! The doubloon goes\n"
 "a-begging! See the sun! Aye, aye, it must be so. I've oversailed\n"
 "him. How, got the start? Aye, he's chasing me now; not I, him - that's\n"
 "bad; I might have known it, too. Fool! the lines - the harpoons he's\n"
 "towing. Aye, aye, I have run him by last night. About! about! Come\n"
 "down, all of ye, but the regular look outs! Man the braces!\"  Steering\n"
 "as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod's quarter,\n"
 "so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the braced ship\n"
 "sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own\n"
 "white wake.  \"Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw,\"\n"
 "murmured Starbuck to himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main- brace\n"
 "upon the rail. \"God keep us, but already my bones feel\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " damp within me, and from the inside wet my flesh. I misdoubt\n"
 "me that I disobey my God in obeying him!\"  \"Stand by to sway me up!\"\n"
 "cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket. \"We should meet him soon.\"\n"
 "\"Aye, aye, Sir,\" and straightway Starbuck did Ahab's bidding, and once\n"
 "more Ahab swung on high.  A whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to\n"
 "ages. time itself now held long breaths with keen suspense. But at\n"
 "last, some three points off the weather bow, Ahab descried the spout\n"
 "again, and instantly from the three mast-heads three shrieks went up\n"
 "as if the tongues of fire had voiced it.  \"Forehead to forehead I meet\n"
 "thee, this third time, Moby Dick! On deck there! - brace sharper up;\n"
 "crowd her into the wind's eye. He's too far off to lower yet,\n"
 "Mr. Starbuck. The sails shake! Stand over that helmsman with a top-\n"
 "maul! So, so; he travels fast, and I must down. But let me have one\n"
 "more good round look aloft here at the sea; there's time for that. An\n"
 "old, old sight, and yet somehow so young; aye, and not changed a wink\n"
 "since I first saw it, a boy, from the sand-hills of Nantucket! The\n"
 "same! - the same! - the same to Noah as to me.  There's a soft shower\n"
 "to leeward. Such lovely leewardings! They must lead somewhere - to\n"
 "something else than common land, more palmy than the palms.  Leeward!\n"
 "the white whale goes that way; look to windward, then; the better if\n"
 "the bitterer quarter. But good bye, good bye, old mast-head! What's\n"
 "this? - green? aye, tiny mosses in these warped cracks. No such green\n"
 "weather stains on Ahab's head! There's the difference now between\n"
 "man's old age and matter's. But aye, old mast, we both grow old\n"
 "together; sound in our hulls, though, are we not, my ship? Aye, minus\n"
 "a leg, that's all. By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live\n"
 "flesh every way. I can't compare with it; and I've known some ships\n"
 "made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital\n"
 "stuff of vital fathers. What's that he said? he should still go before\n"
 "me, my pilot; and yet to be seen again? But where? Will I have eyes at\n"
 "the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs? and\n"
 "all night I've been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to. Aye,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " aye, like many more thou told'st direful truth as touching\n"
 "thyself, O Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short. Good by,\n"
 "mast- head - keep a good eye upon the whale, the while I'm gone. We'll\n"
 "talk to-morrow, nay, to-night, when the white whale lies down there,\n"
 "tied by head and tail.\"  He gave the word; and still gazing round him,\n"
 "was steadily lowered through the cloven blue air to the deck.  In due\n"
 "time the boats were lowered, but as standing in his shallop's stern,\n"
 "Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to the mate,\n"
 "- who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck - and bade him pause.\n"
 "\"Starbuck!\"  \"Sir?\"  \"For the third time my soul's ship starts upon\n"
 "this voyage, Starbuck.\"  \"Aye, Sir, thou wilt have it so.\"  \"Some\n"
 "ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing,\n"
 "Starbuck!\"  \"Truth, Sir: saddest truth.\"  \"Some men die at ebb tide;\n"
 "some at low water; some at the full of the flood; - and I feel now\n"
 "like a billow that's all one crested comb, Starbuck. I am old; - shake\n"
 "hands with me, man.\"  Their hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck's\n"
 "tears the glue.  \"Oh, my captain, my captain! - noble heart - go not -\n"
 "go not! - see, it's a brave man that weeps; how great the agony of the\n"
 "persuasion then!\"  \"Lower away!\" - cried Ahab, tossing the mate's arm\n"
 "from him. \"Stand by the crew!\"  In an instant the boat was pulling\n"
 "round close under the stern.  \"The sharks! the sharks!\" cried a voice\n"
 "from the low cabin-window there; \"O master, my master, come back!\"\n"
 "But Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and\n"
 "the boat leaped on.  Yet the voice spake true; for scarce had he\n"
 "pushed from the ship, when numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from\n"
 "out the dark waters beneath the hull, maliciously snapped at the\n"
 "blades of the oars, every time they dipped in the water; and in this\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " way accompanied the boat with their bites. It is a thing not\n"
 "uncommonly happening to the whale-boats in those swarming seas; the\n"
 "sharks at times apparently following them in the same prescient way\n"
 "that vultures hover over the banners of marching regiments in the\n"
 "east. But these were the first sharks that had been observed by the\n"
 "Pequod since the White Whale had been first descried; and whether it\n"
 "was that Ahab's crew were all such tiger- yellow barbarians, and\n"
 "therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharks - a\n"
 "matter sometimes well known to affect them, - however it was, they\n"
 "seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others.  \"Heart\n"
 "of wrought steel!\" murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and\n"
 "following with his eyes the receding boat - \"canst thou yet ring\n"
 "boldly to that sight?\" - lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and\n"
 "followed by them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical\n"
 "third day? - For when three days flow together in one continuous\n"
 "intense pursuit; be sure the first is the morning, the second the\n"
 "noon, and the third the evening and the end of that thing - be that\n"
 "end what it may. Oh! my God! what is this that shoots through me, and\n"
 "leaves me so deadly calm, yet expectant, - fixed at the top of a\n"
 "shudder! Future things swim before me, as in empty outlines and\n"
 "skeletons; all the past is somehow grown dim. Mary, girl! thou fadest\n"
 "in pale glories behind me; boy! I seem to see but thy eyes grown\n"
 "wondrous blue. Strangest problems of life seem clearing; but clouds\n"
 "sweep between - Is my journey's end coming? My legs feel faint; like\n"
 "his who has footed it all day. Feel thy heart, - beats it yet? - Stir\n"
 "thyself, Starbuck! - stave it off - move, move! speak aloud! -\n"
 "Mast-head there! See ye my boy's hand on the hill? - Crazed; - aloft\n"
 "there! - keep thy keenest eye upon the boats: - mark well the whale! -\n"
 "Ho! again! - drive off that hawk! see! he pecks - he tears the vane -\n"
 "pointing to the red flag flying at the main-truck - \"Ha! he soars away\n"
 "with it! - Where's the old man now? sees't thou that sight, oh Ahab!\n"
 "- shudder, shudder!\"  The boats had not gone very far, when by a\n"
 "signal from the mast-heads - a downward pointed arm, Ahab knew that\n"
 "the whale had sounded; but intending to be near him at the next\n"
 "rising, he\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " held on his way a little sideways from the vessel; the\n"
 "becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence, as the head-beat\n"
 "waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow.  \"Drive, drive\n"
 "in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads, drive them in!\n"
 "ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and no hearse can\n"
 "be mine: - and hemp only can kill me! Ha! ha!\"  Suddenly the waters\n"
 "around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then quickly upheaved, as\n"
 "if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice, swiftly rising to\n"
 "the surface. A low rumbling sound was heard; a subterraneous hum; and\n"
 "then all held their breaths; as bedraggled with trailing ropes, and\n"
 "harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise, but obliquely from\n"
 "the sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist, it hovered for a\n"
 "moment in the rainbowed air; and then fell swamping back into the\n"
 "deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for an instant\n"
 "like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes,\n"
 "leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble\n"
 "trunk of the whale.  \"Give way!\" cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the\n"
 "boats darted forward to the attack; but maddened by yesterday's fresh\n"
 "irons that corroded in him, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by\n"
 "all the angels that fell from heaven. The wide tiers of welded tendons\n"
 "overspreading his broad white forehead, beneath the transparent skin,\n"
 "looked knitted together; as head on, he came churning his tail among\n"
 "the boats; and once more flailed them apart; spilling out the irons\n"
 "and lances from the two mates' boats, and dashing in one side of the\n"
 "upper part of their bows, but leaving Ahab's almost without a scar.\n"
 "While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as\n"
 "the whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank\n"
 "as he shot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up. Lashed\n"
 "round and round to the fish's back; pinioned in the turns upon turns\n"
 "in which, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions\n"
 "of the lines around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen;\n"
 "his sable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full\n"
 "upon old Ahab.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " The harpoon dropped from his hand.  \"Befooled, befooled!\" -\n"
 "drawing in a long lean breath - \"Aye, Parsee! I see thee again. - Aye,\n"
 "and thou goest before; and this, this then is the hearse that thou\n"
 "didst promise. But I hold thee to the last letter of thy word. Where\n"
 "is the second hearse? Away, mates, to the ship! those boats are\n"
 "useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and return to me; if not,\n"
 "Ahab is enough to die - Down, men! the first thing that but offers to\n"
 "jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon. Ye are not other\n"
 "men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me.  - Where's the whale?\n"
 "gone down again?\"  But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent\n"
 "upon escaping with the corpse he bore, and as if the particular place\n"
 "of the last encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby\n"
 "Dick was now again steadily swimming forward; and had almost passed\n"
 "the ship, - which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction\n"
 "to him, though for the present her headway had been stopped. He seemed\n"
 "swimming with his utmost velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing\n"
 "his own straight path in the sea.  \"Oh! Ahab,\" cried Starbuck, \"not\n"
 "too late is it, even now, the third day, to desist. See! Moby Dick\n"
 "seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that madly seekest him!\"  Setting\n"
 "sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to\n"
 "leeward, by both oars and canvas. And at last when Ahab was sliding by\n"
 "the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck's face as he\n"
 "leaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and\n"
 "follow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing\n"
 "upwards, he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to\n"
 "the three mast- heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two\n"
 "staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side, and were\n"
 "busily at work in repairing them. One after the other, through the\n"
 "portholes, as he sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and\n"
 "Flask, busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and\n"
 "lances. As he saw all this; as he heard the hammers in the broken\n"
 "boats; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart. But he\n"
 "rallied. And now marking that the vane or\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " flag was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to\n"
 "Tashtego, who had just gained that perch, to descend again for another\n"
 "flag, and a hammer and nails, and so nail it to the mast.  Whether\n"
 "fagged by the three days' running chase, and the resistance to his\n"
 "swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some latent\n"
 "deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White Whale's\n"
 "way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly nearing\n"
 "him once more; though indeed the whale's last start had not been so\n"
 "long a one as before. And still as Ahab glided over the waves the\n"
 "unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to the\n"
 "boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades\n"
 "became jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at\n"
 "almost every dip.  \"Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks\n"
 "to your oars. Pull on! 'tis the better rest, the shark's jaw than the\n"
 "yielding water.\"  \"But at every bite, Sir, the thin blades grow\n"
 "smaller and smaller!\"  \"They will last long enough! pull on! - But who\n"
 "can tell\" - he muttered - \"whether these sharks swim to feast on the\n"
 "whale or on Ahab? - But pull on! Aye, all alive, now - we near\n"
 "him. The helm! take the helm; let me pass,\" - and so saying, two of\n"
 "the oarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still flying boat.\n"
 "At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along\n"
 "with the White Whale's flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its\n"
 "advance - as the whale sometimes will - and Ahab was fairly within the\n"
 "smoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale's spout, curled\n"
 "round his great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when,\n"
 "with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the\n"
 "poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the\n"
 "hated whale. As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked\n"
 "into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his\n"
 "nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so\n"
 "suddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been for the elevated\n"
 "part of the gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once more have\n"
 "been tossed into the sea.\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " As it was, three of the oarsmen - who foreknew not the\n"
 "precise instant of the dart, and were therefore unprepared for its\n"
 "effects - these were flung out; but so fell, that, in an instant two\n"
 "of them clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a\n"
 "combing wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again; the third man\n"
 "helplessly dropping astern, but still afloat and swimming.  Almost\n"
 "simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated, instantaneous\n"
 "swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering sea. But when\n"
 "Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line, and\n"
 "hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on their seats, and\n"
 "tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the treacherous line felt that\n"
 "double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air!  \"What breaks in\n"
 "me? Some sinew cracks! - 'tis whole again; oars! oars! Burst in upon\n"
 "him!\"  Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale\n"
 "wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that\n"
 "evolution, catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship;\n"
 "seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking\n"
 "it - it may be - a larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down\n"
 "upon its advancing prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.\n"
 "Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. \"I grow blind; hands!\n"
 "stretch out before me that I may yet grope my way. Is't night?\"  \"The\n"
 "whale! The ship!\" cried the cringing oarsmen.  \"Oars! oars Slope\n"
 "downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be for ever too late, Ahab\n"
 "may slide this last, last time upon his mark; I see: the ship! the\n"
 "ship! Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?\"  But as the oarsmen\n"
 "violently forced their boat through the sledge-hammering seas, the\n"
 "before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks burst through, and in an\n"
 "instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with\n"
 "the waves; its half-wading, splashing crew, trying hard to stop the\n"
 "gap and bale out the pouring water.  Meantime, for that one beholding\n"
 "instant, Tashtego's mast-head hammer remained suspended in his hand;\n"
 "and the red\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " flag, half-wrapping him as with a plaid, then streamed itself\n"
 "straight out from him, as his own forward-flowing heart; while\n"
 "Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the bowsprit beneath, caught sight\n"
 "of the down-coming monster just as soon as he.  \"The whale, the whale!\n"
 "Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet powers of air, now hug me close!\n"
 "Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a woman's fainting fit. Up\n"
 "helm, I say - ye fools, the jaw! the jaw! Is this the end of all my\n"
 "bursting prayers? all my life-long fidelities? Oh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy\n"
 "work. Steady!  helmsman, steady. Nay, nay! Up helm again! He turns to\n"
 "meet us! Oh, his unappeasable brow drives on towards one, whose duty\n"
 "tells him he cannot depart.  My God, stand by me now!\"  \"Stand not by\n"
 "me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now help Stubb; for\n"
 "Stubb, too, sticks here. I grin at thee, thou grinning whale! Who ever\n"
 "helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but Stubb's own unwinking eye? And\n"
 "now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too soft; would\n"
 "it were stuffed with brushwood! I grin at thee, thou grinning whale!\n"
 "Look ye, sun, moon, and stars! I call ye assassins of as good a fellow\n"
 "as ever spouted up his ghost. For all that, I would yet ring glasses\n"
 "with ye, would ye but hand the cup! Oh, oh!  oh, oh! thou grinning\n"
 "whale, but there'll be plenty of gulping soon! Why fly ye not, O Ahab!\n"
 "For me, off shoes and jacket to it; let Stubb die in his drawers! A\n"
 "most mouldy and over salted death, though; - cherries! cherries!\n"
 "cherries! Oh, Flask, for one red cherry ere we die!\"  \"Cherries? I\n"
 "only wish that we were where they grow. Oh, Stubb, I hope my poor\n"
 "mother's drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few coppers will now come\n"
 "to her, for the voyage is up.\"  From the ship's bows, nearly all the\n"
 "seamen now hung inactive; hammers, bits of plank, lances, and\n"
 "harpoons, mechanically retained in their hands, just as they had\n"
 "darted from their various employments; all their enchanted eyes intent\n"
 "upon the whale, which from side to side strangely vibrating his\n"
 "predestinating head, sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular\n"
 "foam before him as he rushed.  Retribution, swift vengeance, eternal\n"
 "malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of all that mortal man\n"
 "could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " smote the ship's starboard bow, till men and timbers\n"
 "reeled. Some fell flat upon their faces. Like dislodged trucks, the\n"
 "heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their bull-like necks. Through\n"
 "the breach, they heard the waters pour, as mountain torrents down a\n"
 "flume.  \"The ship! The hearse! - the second hearse!\" cried Ahab from\n"
 "the boat; \"its wood could only be American!\"  Diving beneath the\n"
 "settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its keel; but turning\n"
 "under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far off the other bow,\n"
 "but within a few yards of Ahab's boat, where, for a time, he lay\n"
 "quiescent.  \"I turn my body from the sun. What ho, Tashtego! Let me\n"
 "hear thy hammer. Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou\n"
 "uncracked keel; and only god-bullied hull; thou firm deck, and haughty\n"
 "helm, and Pole-pointed prow, - death-glorious ship! must ye then\n"
 "perish, and without me? Am I cut off from the last fond pride of\n"
 "meanest shipwrecked captains? Oh, lonely death on lonely life! Oh, now\n"
 "I feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief. Ho, ho! from all\n"
 "your furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole\n"
 "foregone life, and top this one piled comber of my death! Towards thee\n"
 "I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I\n"
 "grapple with thee; from hell's heart I stab at thee; for hate's sake I\n"
 "spit my last breath at thee. Sink all coffins and all hearses to one\n"
 "common pool! and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces,\n"
 "while still chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale!\n"
 "Thus, I give up the spear!\"  The harpoon was darted; the stricken\n"
 "whale flew forward; with igniting velocity the line ran through the\n"
 "groove; - ran foul. Ahab stooped to clear it; he did clear it; but the\n"
 "flying turn caught him round the neck, and voicelessly as Turkish\n"
 "mutes bowstring their victim, he was shot out of the boat, ere the\n"
 "crew knew he was gone. Next instant, the heavy eye-splice in the\n"
 "rope's final end flew out of the stark-empty tub, knocked down an\n"
 "oarsman, and smiting the sea, disappeared in its depths.  For an\n"
 "instant, the tranced boat's crew stood still; then turned. \"The ship?\n"
 "Great God, where is the ship?\" Soon they through dim, bewildering\n"
 "mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom,\n"
 "\n"
 "\n"
 " as in the gaseous Fata Morgana; only the uppermost masts out\n"
 "of water; while fixed by infatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to their\n"
 "once lofty perches, the pagan harpooneers still maintained their\n"
 "sinking lookouts on the sea. And now, concentric circles seized the\n"
 "lone boat itself, and all its crew, and each floating oar, and every\n"
 "lance-pole, and spinning, animate and inanimate, all round and round\n"
 "in one vortex, carried the smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight.\n"
 "But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the\n"
 "sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the\n"
 "erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the\n"
 "flag, which calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the\n"
 "destroying billows they almost touched; - at that instant, a red arm\n"
 "and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act\n"
 "of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar.  A\n"
 "sky-hawk that tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from\n"
 "its natural home among the stars, pecking at the flag, and incommoding\n"
 "Tashtego there; this bird now chanced to intercept its broad\n"
 "fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood; and simultaneously\n"
 "feeling that etherial thrill, the submerged savage beneath, in his\n"
 "death-gasp, kept his hammer frozen there; and so the bird of heaven,\n"
 "with archangelic shrieks, and his imperial beak thrust upwards, and\n"
 "his whole captive form folded in the flag of Ahab, went down with his\n"
 "ship, which, like Satan, would not sink to hell till she had dragged a\n"
 "living part of heaven along with her, and helmeted herself with it.\n"
 "Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen\n"
 "white surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the\n"
 "great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years\n"
 "ago.  And I only am escaped alone to tell thee. JOB The Drama's\n"
 "Done. Why then here does any one step forth? - Because one did survive\n"
 "the wreck.  It so chanced, that after the Parsee's disappearance, I\n"
 "was he whom the Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab's bowsman,\n"
 "when that bowsman assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the\n"
 "last day the three men were tossed from out the rocking boat, was\n"
 "dropped astern. So. floating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and\n"
 "in full sight of it, when the half-spent suction of the sunk ship\n"
 "reached me, I was then, but slowly, drawn towards the closing\n"
 "vortex. When I reached it, it had subsided to a creamy pool. Round and\n"
 "round, then, and ever contracting towards the button-like black bubble\n"
 "at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle, like another ixion I did\n"
 "revolve. till gaining that vital centre, the black bubble upward\n"
 "burst; and now, liberated by reason of its cunning spring, and owing\n"
 "to its great buoyancy, rising with great force, the coffin like-buoy\n"
 "shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and floated by my\n"
 "side. Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost one whole day and night, I\n"
 "floated on a soft and dirge-like main. The unharming sharks, they\n"
 "glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks\n"
 "sailed with sheathed beaks. On the second day, a sail drew near,\n"
 "nearer, and picked me up at last. It was the devious-cruising Rachel,\n"
 "that in her retracing search after her missing children, only found\n"
 "another orphan.  finis";
